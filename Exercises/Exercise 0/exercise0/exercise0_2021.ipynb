    "## Exercise Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise sheets come in form of Jupyter notebooks, which consist of different cells.\n",
    "These can be used for markdowns (like this cell) or Python code.\n",
    "Each cell can be run separately to present the text properly or to execute the code.\n",
    "It is also possible to use $\\LaTeX$ equations inside the markdown environment.\n",
    "For more information about how to install and start Jupyter, visit https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n",
    "\n",
    "The given Jupyter notebook should be filled out by where it is marked.\n",
    "There are either pen and paper questions to answer or programming tasks to code.\n",
    "You should answer the programming tasks inside this notebook.\n",
    "The theoretical questions can be answered here as well using the Markdown cells.\n",
    "It is also possible to answer them by pen and paper and scan the solution as a pdf.\n",

    "## Hand In\n",
    "- Hand In is over Ilias. \n",
    "- Only one person per group needs to hand it in, but please still put the names of all three\n",
    "- Deadline just before the presentation of the solution \n",
    "\n",
    "Handing in Notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the submission of the exercise please follow these steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure that every cell is executed and the output is printed.\n",
    "2. Create a PdF of the Jupyter notebook via *File $\\rightarrow$ Download as $\\rightarrow$ PDF via LaTeX (.pdf)* or\n",
    " *File $\\rightarrow$ Print Preview $\\rightarrow$ Use your favorite PDF printing program*\n",
    "3. Zip your created PdF file and your original notebook, i.e. the .ipynb file,\n",
    "as well as your separate pen and paper solutions (if existent) together.\n",
    "4. Rename your zip file with the following naming convention: group_y_uxxxx_uxxxx_uxxxx\n",
    "where y is your group number, uxxxx is the kit user from each group member/\n",
    "5. Upload the zip file to Ilias. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveat**: Last year there were some issues with formulas in the exercises not \"compiling\" for some students. We try to make sure it works on our systems but, as there are differences between tex versions and different operating systems we can not always guarantee it. **If some of our equations do not work for you, just delete it from your hand-in** "
