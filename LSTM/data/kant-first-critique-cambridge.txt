PREFACE a,iI 
AVll PREFACE a,iI 
AVll 
Human reason has the peculiar fate in one species of its cognitions that 
it is burdened with questions which it cannot dismiss, since they are 
given to it as problemsb by the nature of reason itself, but which it also 
cannot answer, since they transcend every capacity" of human reason. 

Reason falls into this perplexity through no fault of its own. It begins 
from principles whose use is unavoidable in the course of experience 
and at the same time sufficiently warranted by it. With these principles 
it rises (as its nature also requires) ever higher, to more remote conditions. 
But since it becomes aware in this way that its business must always 
remain incomplete because the questions never cease, reason sees 
itself necessitated to take refuge in principles that overstep all possible 
use in experience, and yet seem so unsuspicious that even ordinary 
common sense agrees with them. But it thereby falls into obscurity and 
contradictions, from which it can indeed surmise that it must somewhere 
be proceeding on the ground of hidden errors; but it cannot discover 
them, for the principles on which it is proceeding, since they 
surpass the bounds of all experience, no longer recognize any touchstone 
of experience. The battlefield of these endless controversies is 
called metaphysics. 

There was a time when metaphysics was called the queen of all the 
sciences, and if the will be taken for the deed, it deserved this title of 
honor, on account of the preeminent importance of its object. Now, in 
accordance with the fashion of the age, the queen proves despised on all 
sides; and the matron, outcast and forsaken, mourns like Hecuba: Modo 
maxima rerum, tot generis natisque potens -nunc trahor exul, inops Ovid, Arix

-

Metamorphoses. d 

In the beginning, under the administration of the dogmatists,2 her 
rule was despotic. Yet because her legislation still retained traces of ancient 
barbarism, this rule gradually degenerated through internal wars 
into complete anarchy; and the skeptics,3 a kind of nomads who abhor 
all permanent cultivation of the soil, shattered civil unity from time to

claims would be completely decided, through a certain physiology of 
.the human understanding (by the famous Locke);4 but it turned out that 
although the birth of the purported queen was traced to the rabble of 
common experience and her pretensions would therefore have been 
rightly rendered suspicious, nevertheless she still asserted her claims, 
Preface <A> 


time. But since there were fortunately only a few of them, they could 
not prevent the dogmatists from continually attempting to rebuild, 
though never according to a plan unanimously accepted among themselves. 
Once in recent times it even seemed as though an end would be 
put to all these controversies, and the lawfulnesso of all the competing 

because in fact this genealogy was attributed to her falsely; thus meta-

AX physics fell back into the same old worm-eaten dogmatism, and thus 
into the same position of contempt out of which the science was to have 
been extricated. Now after all paths (as we persuade ourselves) have 
been tried in vain, what rules is tedium and complete indifferentism,s 
the mother of chaos and night in the sciences, but at the same time also 
the origin, or at least the prelude, of their incipient transformation and 
enlightenment, when through ill-applied effort they have become obscure, 
confused, and useless. 


For it is pointless to affect indifference with respect to such inquiries, 
to whose object human nature cannot be indifferent. Moreover, 
however much they may think to make themselves unrecognizable 
by exchanging the language of the schools for a popular style, these socalled 
indifferentists, to the extent that they think anything at all, always 
unavoidably fall back into metaphysical assertions, which they yet 
professed so much to despise. Nevertheless this indifference, occurring 
amid the flourishing of all sciences, and directed precisely at those sciences 
whose resultsb (if such are to be had at all) we could least do without, 
is a phenomenon deserving our attention and reflection. This is 
evidently the effect not of the thoughtlessness of our age, but of its 
ripened power of judgment, * which will no longer be put off with il


AX! 
* Now and again one hears complaints about the superficiality of our age's way 
of thinking, and about the decay of well-grounded science. Yet I do not see 
that those sciences whose grounds are well laid, such as mathematics, physics, 
etc., in the least deserve this charge; rather, they maintain their old reputation 
for well-groundedness, and in the case of natural science, even surpass it. This 
same spirit would also prove itself effective in other species of cognition if 
only care had first been taken to correct their principles. C In the absence of 
this, indifference, doubt, and finally strict criticism are rather proofs of a wellgrounded 
way of thinking. Our age is the genuine age of criticism, to which

lusory knowledge, and which demands that reason should take on anew 
the most difficult of all its tasks, namely, that of self-knowledge,a and to 
institute a court of justice, by which reason may secure its rightful 
claims while dismissing all its groundless pretensions, and this not by 

mere decrees but according to its own eternal and unchangeable laws; AXIl 

and this court is none other than the critique of pure reason itself.6 

Yet by this I do not understand a critique of books and systems, but a 
critique of the faculty of r􀜈_ason in general, in respect of all the cognitions 
after which reasonb might strive independendy of all experience, 
and hence the decision about the possibility or impossibility of a 
metaphysics in general, and the determination of its sources, as well as 
its extent and boundaries, all, however, from principles.c 

It is on this path, the only one left, that I have set forth, and I flatter 
myself that in following it I have succeeded in removing all those errors 
that have so far put reason into dissension with itself in its nonexperiential 
use. I have not avoided reason's questions by pleading the incapacity 
of human reason as an excuse; rather I have completely specified 
these questions according to principles,d and after discovering the point 
where reason has misunderstood itself, I have resolved them to reason's 
full satisfaction. To be sure, the answer to these questions has not 
turned out just as dogmatically enthusiastic lust for knowledge might 
have expected; for the latter could not be satisfied except through magical 
powers in which I am not an expert. Yet this was also not the intent 
of our reason's natural vocation; and the duty of philosophy was to abolish 
the semblance arising from misinterpretation, even if many prized 
and beloved delusions have to be destroyed in the process. In this business 
I have made comprehensiveness my chief aim in view, and I make 
bold to say that there cannot be a single metaphysical problem that has 
not been solved here, or at least to the solution of which the key has not 
been provided. In fact pure reason is such a perfect unity that if its principle' 
were insufficient for even a single one of the questions that are set 

everything must submit. Religion through its holiness and legislation 
through its majesty commonly seek to exempt themselves from it. But in this 
way they excite a just suspicion against themselves, and cannot lay claim to 
that unfeigned respect that reason grants only to that which has been able to 
withstand its free and public examination.

for it by its own nature, then this [principle] might as well be discarded, 
because then it also would not be up to answering any of the other questions 
with complete reliability.? 
While I am saying this I believe I perceive in the face of the reader 
Axiv an indignation mixed with contempt at claims that are apparently so 
pretentious and immodest; and yet they are incomparably more moderate 
than those of any author of the commonest program who pretends 
to prove the simple nature of the soul or the necessity of a first beginning 
of the world. For such an author pledges himself to extend 
human cognition beyond all bounds of possible experience, of which I 
humbly admit that this wholly surpasses my capacity; instead I have to 
do merely with reason itself and its pure thinking; to gain exhaustive acquaintance 
with them I need not seek far beyond myself, because it is in 
myself that I encounter them, and common logic already also gives me 
an example of how the simple acts of reason may be fully and systematically 
enumerated; only here the question is raised how much I may 
hope to settle with these simple acts if all the material and assistance of 
experience are taken away from me. 
So much for the completeness in reaching each of the ends, and for 
the comprehensiveness in reaching all of them together, which ends 
are not proposed arbitrarily, but are set up for us by the nature of cognition 
itself, as the matter of our critical investigation. 

AXV Furthermore certainty and clarity, two things that concern the 
form of the investigation, are to be viewed as essential demands, which 
may rightly be made on the author who ventures upon so slippery an 
undertaking. 

As far as certainty is concerned, I have myself pronounced the judgment 
that in this kind of inquiry it is in no way allowed to hold opinions, 
and that anything that even looks like an hypothesis is a forbidden 
commodity, which should not be put up for sale even at the lowest price 
but must be confiscated as soon as it is discovered. For every cognition 
that is supposed to be certain a priori proclaims that it wants to be held 
for absolutely necessary, and even more is this true of a determination 
of all pure cognitions a priori, which is to be the standard and thus even 
the example of all apodictic (philosophical) certainty. Whether I have 
performed what I have just pledged in that respect remains wholly to 
the judgment of the reader, since it is appropriate for an author only to 
present the grounds, but not to judge about their effect on his judges. 
But in order that he should not inadvertently be the cause of weaken-

Axvi ing his own arguments, the author may be permitted to note himself 
those places that, even though they pertain only to the incidental end of 
the work, may be the occasion for some mistrust, in order that he may 
in a timely manner counteract the influence that even the reader's 


102 



Preface <A> 

slightest reservation on this point may have on his judgment over the 
chief end. 

I am acquainted with no investigations more important for getting to 
the bottom of that faculty we call the understanding, and at the same 
time for the determination of the rules and boundaries of its use, than 
those I have undertaken in the second chapter of the Transcendental 
Analytic, under the title Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the 
Understanding; they are also the investigations that have cost me the 
most, but I hope liot unrewarded, effort. This inquiry, which goes 
rather deep, has two sides. One side refers to the objects of the pure understanding, 
and is supposed to demonstrate and make comprehensible 
the objective validity of its concepts a priori; thus it belongs essentially 
to my ends. The other side deals with the pure understanding itself, 
concerning its possibility and the powers of cognition on which it itself 
rests; thus it considers it in a subjective relation, and although this ex-AXV11 
position is of great importance in respect of my chief end, it does not 
belong essentially to it; because the chief question always remains: 
"What and how much can understanding and reason cognize free of all 
experience?" and not: "How is the faculty of thinking itself possible?"g 
Since the latter question is something like the search for the cause of a 
given effect, and is therefore something like a hypothesis (although, as 
I will elsewhere take the opportunity to show, this is not in fact how 
matters stand), it appears as if I am taking the liberty in this case of expressing 
an opinion, and that the reader might therefore be free to hold 
another opinion. In view of this I must remind the reader in advance 
that even in case my subjective deduction does not produce the complete 
conviction that I expect, the objective deduction that is my primary 
concern would come into its full strength, on which what is said 
at pages [AJ 92-3 should even be sufficient by itself. 

Finally, as regards clarity, a the reader has a right to demand first discursive 
(logical) clarity, through concepts, but then also intuitive 
(aesthetic) clarity, through intuitions, that is, through examples or AXVlll 
other illustrations in concreto. I have taken sufficient care for the former. 
That was essential to my undertaking but was also the contingent cause 
of the fact that I could not satisfy the second demand, which is less strict 
but still fair. In the progress of my labor I have been almost constantly 
undecided how to deal with this matter. Examples and illustrations always 
appeared necessary to me, and hence actually appeared in their 
proper place in my first draft. But then I looked at the size of my task 
and the many objects with which I would have to do, and I became 
aware that this alone, treated in a dry, merely scholastic manner, would 

a Deutlichkeit 

; 
103 

Preface <Pi> 

suffice to fill an extensive work; thus I found it inadVisable to swell it 
further with examples and illustrations, which are necessary only for a 
popular aim, especially since this work could never be made suitable for 
popular use, and real experts in this science do not have so much need 
for things to be made easy for them; although this would always be 
agreeable, here it could also have brought with it something counter-

Axix productive. The Abbe Terrasson says that if the size of a book is measured 
not by the number of pages but by the time needed to understand 
it, then it can be said of many a book that it would be much shorter 
if it were not so short.9 But on the other hand, if we direct our view 
toward the intelligibility of a whole of speculative cognition that is 
wide-ranging and yet is connected in principle,a we could with equal 
right say that many a book would have been much clearer if it had 
not been made quite so clear. For the aids to clarity helpb in the parts 
but often confuse in the whole, since the reader cannot quickly enough 
attain a survey of the whole; and all their bright colors paint over and 
make unrecognizable the articulation or structure of the system, which 
yet matters most when it comes to judging its unity and soundness. 10 
It can, as it seems to me, be no small inducement for the reader to 
unite his effort with that of the author, when he has the prospect of carrying 
out, according to the outline given above, a great and important 
piece of work, and that in a complete and lasting way. Now meta-
AXX physics, according to the concepts we will give of it here, is the only one 
of all the sciences that may promise that little but unified effort, and 
that indeed in a short time, will complete it in such a way that nothing 
remains to posterity except to adapt it in a didactic manner to its intentions, 
yet without being able to add to its content in the least. For it 
is nothing but the inventory of all we possess through pure reason, ordered 
systematically. Nothing here can escape us, because what reason 
brings forth entirely out of itself cannot be hidden, but is brought to 
light by reason itself as soon as reason's common principlec has been discovered. 
The perfect unity of this kind of cognition, and the fact that it 
arises solely out of pure concepts without any influence that would extend 
or increase it from experience or even particular intuition, which 
would lead to a determinate experience, make this unconditioned completeness 
not only feasible but also necessary. Tecum habita, et naris quam

under the title Metaphysics of Nature, which will be not half so extensive 
but will be incomparably richer in content than this critique, 
which had first to display the sources and conditions of its possibility, 
and needed to clear and level a ground that was completely overgrown. 
Here I expect from my reader the patience and impartiality of a judge, 
but there I will expect the cooperative spirit and assistance of a fellow 
worker; for however completely the principlesa of the system may be 
expounded in the critique, the comprehensiveness of the system itself 
requires also that no derivative concepts should be lacking, which, 
however, cannot be estimated a priori in one leap, but must be gradually 
sought out; likewise, just as in the former the whole synthesis of concepts 
has been exhausted, so in the latter it would be additionally demanded 
that the same thing should take place in respect of their 
analysis, which would be easy and more entertainment than labor. 

I have only a few more things to remark with respect to the book's 
printing. Since the beginning of the printing was somewhat delayed, I 
was able to see only about half the proof sheets, in which I have come AXX11 
upon a few printing errors, though none that confuse the sense except 
the one occurring at page [A] 379, fourth line from the bottom, where 
specific should be read in place of skeptical. The Antinomy of Pure 
Reason, from page [A] 425 to page [A] 46r, is arranged in the manner 
of a table, so that everything belonging to the thesis always continues 
on the left side and what belongs to the antithesis on the right side, 
which I did in order to make it easier to compare proposition and 
counter-proposition with one another.

Bvii Preface to the second edition a 

Whether or not the treatment of the cognitions belonging to the concern 
of reason travels the secure course of a science is something which 
can soon be judged by its success. If after many preliminaries and preparations 
are made, a science gets stuck as soon as it approaches its end, 
or if in order to reach this end it must often go back and set out on a 
new path; or likewise if it proves impossible for the different co-workers 
to achieve unanimity as to the way in which they should pursueh 
their common aim; then we may be sure that such a study is merely 
groping about, that it is still far from having entered upon the secure 
course of a science; and it is already a service to reason if we can possibly 
find that path for it, even if we have to give up as futile much of what 
was included in the end previously formed without deliberation. 

Bviii That from the earliest times logic has traveled this secure course can 
be seen from the fact that since the time of Aristotle it has not had to 
go a single step backwards, unless we count the abolition of a few dispensable 
subtleties or the more distinct determination of its presentation, 
which improvements belong more to the elegance than to the 
security of that science. What is further remarkable about logic is that 
until now it has also been unable to take a single step forward, and 
therefore seems to all appearance to be finished and complete. For if 
some moderns have thought to enlarge it by interpolating psychological 
chapters about our different cognitive powers (about imagination, 
wit), or metaphysical chapters about the origin of cognition or the different 
kinds of certainty in accordance with the diversity of objects' 
(about idealism, skepticism, etc.), or anthropological chapters about 
our prejudice (about their causes and remedies), then this proceeds only 
from their ignorance of the peculiar nature of this science. It is not an 
improvement but a deformation of the sciences when their boundaries 
are allowed to run over into one another; the boundaries oflogic, however, 
are determined quite precisely by the fact that logic is the science

Preface to the second edition <B> 

rules of all thinking (whether this thinking be empirical or a priori, 
whatever origin or object" it may have, and whatever contingent or natural 
obstacles it may meet with in our minds). 

For the advantage that has made it so successful logic has solely its 
own limitation to thank, since it is thereby justified in abstracting -is 
indeed obliged to abstract -from all objectsb of cognition and all the 
distinctions between them; and in logic, therefore, the understanding 
has to do with nothing further than itself and its own form. How much 
more difficult, naturally, must it be for reason to enter upon the secure 
path of a science if it does not have to do merely with itself, but has to 
deal with objectsC too; hence logic as a propadeutic constitutes only the 
outer courtyard, as it were, to the sciences; and when it comes to information, 
a logic may indeed be presupposed in judging about the latter, 
but its acquisition must be sought in the sciences properly and objectively 
so called. 


Insofar as there is to be reason in these sciences, something in them 
must be cognized a priori, and this cognition can relate to its object in 
either of two ways, either merely determining the object and its conBX 
cept (which must be given from elsewhere), or else also making the object 
actual. The former is theoretical, the latter practical cognition of 
reason. In both the pure part, the part in which reason determines its 
objecti wholly a priori, must be expounded all by itself, however much 
or little it may contain, and that part that comes from other sources 
must not be mixed up with it; for it is bad economy to spend blindly 
whatever comes in without being able later, when the economy comes 
to a standstill, to distinguish the part of the revenue that can cover the 
expenses from the part that must be cut. 

Mathematics and physics are the two theoretical cognitions of reason 
that are supposed to determine their objectse a priori, the former 
entirely purely, the latter at least in part purely but also following the 
standards of sources of cognition other than reason. 

Mathematics has, from the earliest times to which the history of 
human reason reaches, in that admirable people the Greeks, traveled 
the secure path of a science. Yet it must not be thought that it was as 
easy for it as for logic -in which reason has to do only with itself -to 
find that royal path, or rather itself to open it up; rather, I believe that Bxi 
mathematics was left groping about for a long time (chiefly among the 
Egyptians), and that its transformation is to be ascribed to a revolution, 
brought about by the happy inspiration of a single man in an at

tempt from which the road to be taken onward could no longer be 
missed, and the secure course of a science was entered on and prescribed 
for all time and to an infinite extent. The history of this revolution 
in the way of thinking -which was far more important than 
the discovery of the way around the famous CapeII-and of the lucky 
one who brought it about, has not been preserved for us. But the legend 
handed down to us by Diogenes Laertius -who names the 
reputed inventor of the smallest elements of geometrical demonstrations, 
even of those that, according to common judgment, stand in no 
need of proof -proves that the memory of the alteration wrought by 
the discovery of this new path in its earliest footsteps must have 
seemed exceedingly important to mathematicians, and was thereby 
rendered unforgettable. A new light broke upon the first person who 
demonstrated the isoscelesa triangle (whether he was called "Thales" 
or had some other name). 12 For he found that what he had to do was 


Bxii not to trace what he saw in this figure, or even trace its mere concept, 
and read off, as it were, from the properties of the figure; but 
rather that he had to produce the latter from what he himself thought 
into the object and presented (through construction) according to a 
priori concepts, and that in order to know something securely a priori 
he had to ascribe to the thing nothing except what followed necessarily 
from what he himself had put into it in accordance with its 
concept. 


It took natural science much longer to find the highway of science; 
for it is only about one and a half centuries since the suggestion of the 
ingenious Francis Bacon partly occasioned this discovery and partly further 
stimulated it, since one was already on its tracks -which discovery, 
therefore, can just as much be explained by a sudden revolution in the 
way of thinking. Here I will consider natural science only insofar as it 
is grounded on empirical principles.b 

When Galileo'3 rolled balls of a weight chosen by himself down an 
inclined plane, or when Torricelli'4 made the air bear a weight that he 
had previously thought to be equal to that of a known column of water, 
or when in a later time Stahl's changed metals into calxc and then 

Bxiii changed the latter back into metal by first removing something and 

a Kant's text reads "gleichseitig" (equilateral); but on the basis of his correction in a letter to 
Schutz of 2 5 June 1787 (ro:466), he appears to have meant "gleichschenklig" (isosceles).

, Kalk. Kemp Smith translates this as "oxides," but that is anachronistic; prior to the 
chemical revolution of Priestley and Lavoisier, the calx was conceived to be what was 
left of a metal after its phlogiston had been driven off; only later was it discovered that 
this process was actually one of oxidation.

then putting it back again,* a light dawned on all those who study nature. 
They comprehended that reason has insight only into what it itself 
produces according to its own design; that it must take the lead with 
principlesa for its judgments according to constant laws and compel nature 
to answer its questions, rather than letting nature guide its movements 
by keeping reason, as it were, in leading-strings; for otherwise 
accidental observations, made according to no previously designed 
plan, can never connect up into a necessary law, which is yet what reason 
seeks and requires. Reason, in order to be taught by nature, must 
approach nature with its principlesb in one hand, according to which 
alone the agreement among appearances can count as laws, and, in the 
other hand, the experiments thought out in accordance with these principlesc-
yet in order to be instructed by nature not like a pupil, who has 
recited to him whatever the teacher wants to say, but like an appointed 
judge who compels witnesses to answer the questions he puts to them. 
Thus even physics owes the advantageous revolution in its way of thinking 
to the inspiration that what reason would not be able to know of it-BXlV 
self and has to learn from nature, it has to seek in the latter (though not 
merely ascribe to it) in accordance with what reason itself puts into nature. 
This is how natural science was first brought to the secure course 
of a science after groping about for so many centuries. 

Metaphysics -a wholly isolated speculative cognition of reason that 
elevates itself entirely above all instruction from experience, and that 
through mere concepts (not, like mathematics, through the application 
of concepts to intuition), where reason thus is supposed to be its own 
pupil -has up to now not been so favored by fate as to have been able 
to enter upon the secure course of a science, even though it is older than 
all other sciences, and would remain even if all the others were swallowed 
up by an all-consuming barbarism. For in it reason continuously 
gets stuck, even when it claims apriori insight (as it pretends) into those

to retrace our path countless times, because we find that it does not lead

bit of ground, nor has any been able to base any lasting possession on 
his victory. Hence there is no doubt that up to now the procedure of 
metaphysics has been a mere groping, and what is the worst, a groping 
among mere concepts. 

Now why is it that here the secure path of science still could not be 
found? Is it perhaps impossible? Why then has nature afflicted our reason 
with the restless striving for such a path, as if it were one of reason's 
most important occupations? Still more, how little cause have we 
to place trust in our reason if in one of the most important parts of our 
desire for knowledge it does not merely forsake us but even entices us 
with delusions and in the end betrays us! Or if the path has merely 
eluded us so far, what indications may we use that might lead us to hope 
that in renewed attempts we will be luckier than those who have gone 
before us? 

I should think that the examples of mathematics and natural science, 
which have become what they now are through a revolution brought 
about all at once, were remarkable enough that we might reflect on the 
essential element in the change in the ways of thinking that has been so 
advantageous to them, and, at least as an experiment, imitate it insofar 
as their analogy with metaphysics, as rational cognition, might permit. 
Up to now it has been assumed that all our cognition must conform to 
the objects; but all attempts to find out something about them a priori 
through concepts that would extend our cognition have, on this presupposition, 
come to nothing. Hence let us once try whether we do not 
get farther with the problems of metaphysics by assuming that the objectsa 
must conform to our cognition, which would agree better with the 
requested possibility of an a priori cognition of them, which is to establish 
something about objectsb before they are given to us. This would 
be just like the first thoughts of Copernicus,,6 who, when he did not 
make good progress in the explanation of the celestial motions if he assumed 
that the entire celestial host revolves around the observer, tried 
to see if he might not have greater success if he made the observer revolve 
and left the stars at rest. Now in metaphysics we can try in a sim-

Bxvii ilar way regarding the intuition of objects. If intuition has to conform 
to the constitution of the objects, then I do not see how we can know 
anything of them a priori; but if the object (as an objectC of the senses) 
conforms to the constitution of our faculty of intuition, then I can very 
well represent this possibility to myself. Yet because I cannot stop with 
these intuitions, if they are to become cognitions, but must refer them 
as representations to something as their object and determine this ob-

ject through them, I can assume either that the concepts through which 
I bring about this determination also conform to the objects, and then 
I am once again in the same difficulty about how I could know anything 
about them a priori, or else I assume that the objects, or what is the same 
thing, the experience in which alone they can be cognized (as given objects) 
conforms to those concepts, in which case I immediately see an 
easier way out of the difficulty, since experience itself is a kind of cognition 
requiring the understanding, whose rule I have to presuppose in 
myself before any object is given to me, hence a priori, which rule is expressed 
in concepts a priori, to which all objects of experience must 
therefore necessarily conform, and with which they must agree. As for 
objects insofar as they are thought merely through reason, and necessarily 
at that, but that (at least as reason thinks them) cannot be given 
in experience at allo-the attempt to think them (for they must be capable 
of being thought) will provide a splendid touchstone of what we as


sume as the altered method of our way of thinking, namely that we can 
cognize of things a priori only what we ourselves have put into them.* 
This experiment succeeds as well as we could wish, and it promises to 

metaphysics the secure course of a science in its first part, where it concerns 
itself with concepts a priori to which the corresponding objects appropriate 
to them can be given in experience. For after this alteration in 
our way of thinking we can very well explain the possibility of a cognition 
a priori, and what is still more, we can provide satisfactory proofs of 
the laws that are the a priori ground of nature, as the sum total of objects 
of experience -which were both impossible according to the earlier way 
of proceeding. But from this deduction of our faculty of cognizing a pri

sists in this: to seek the elements of pure reason in that which admits of 
being confirmed or refuted through an experiment. Now the propositions 
of pure reason, especially when they venture beyond all boundaries of 
possible experience, admit of no test by experiment with their objects"(as in 
natural science): thus to experiment will be feasible only with concepts and 
principles that we assume a priori by arranging the latter so that the same 
objects can be considered from two different sides, on the one side as objects 
of the senses and the understanding for experience, and on the other Bxix 
side as objects that are merely thought at most for isolated reason striving 
beyond the bounds of experience. If we now find that there is agreement with 
the principleb of pure reason when things are considered from this twofold 
standpoint, but that an unavoidable conflict of reason with itself arises with a 
single standpoint, then the experiment decides for the correctness of that 
distinction.

ori in the first part of metaphysics, there emerges a very strange result, 
and one that appears very disadvantageous to the whole purpose with 
which the second part of metaphysics concerns itself, namely that with 
this faculty we can never get beyond the boundaries of possible experience, 
which is nevertheless precisely the most essential occupation of 
BXX this science. But herein lies just the experiment providing a checkupu on 
the truth of the result of that first assessment of our rational cognition 
a priori, namely that such cognition reaches appearances only, leaving 
the thini' in itself as something actual for itself but uncognized by us. 
For that which necessarily drives us to go beyond the boundaries of experience 
and all appearances is the unconditioned, which reason necessarily 
and with every right demands in things in themselves for 
everything that is conditioned, thereby demanding the series of conditions 
as something completed. Now if we find that on the assumption 
that our cognition from experience conforms to the objects as things in 
themselves, the unconditioned cannot be thought at all without contradiction, 
but that on the contrary, if we assume that our representation 
of things as they are given to us does not conform to these things 
as they are in themselves but rather that these objects as appearances 
conform to our way of representing, then the contradiction disappears; 
and consequently that the unconditioned must not be presentC in 
things insofar as we are acquainted with them (insofar as they are given 
to us), but rather in things insofar as we are not acquainted with them, 
as thingsd in themselves: then this would show that what we initially assumed 
only as an experiment is well grounded.* Now after speculative 
reason has been denied all advance in this field of the supersensible, 
what still remains for us is to try whether there are not data in reason's 
practical data for determining that transcendent rational concept of the 
unconditioned, in such a way as to reach beyond the boundaries of all 
possible experience, in accordance with the wishes of metaphysics, cognitions 
a priori that are possible, but only from a practical standpoint. By 

* This experiment of pure reason has much in common with what the 
chemists sometimes call the experiment of reduction, or more generally the 
synthetic procedure. The analysis of the metaphysician separated pure a 
priori knowledge into two very heterogeneous elements, namely those of the 
things as appearances and the things in themselves. The dialectic once again 
combines them, in unison with the necessary rational idea of the unconditioned, 
and finds that the unison will never come about except through that 
distinction, which is therefore the true one.

such procedures speculative reason has at least made room for such an 
extension, even if it had to leave it empty; and we remain at liberty, in


deed we are called upon by reason to fill it if we can through practical Bxxii 

data of reason. * 
Now the concern of this critique of pure speculative reason consists 
in that attempt to transform the accepted procedure of metaphysics, un


dertaking an entire revolution according to the example of the geometers 
and natural scientists. It is a treatise on the method, not a system of 
the science itself; but it catalogs the entire outline of the science of 

metaphysics, both in respect of its boundaries and in respect of its entire 
internal structure. For pure speculative reason has this peculiarity BXXlll 
about it, that it can and should measure its own capacitya according to 

the different ways for choosing the objectsob of its thinking, and also 
completely enumerate the manifold ways of putting problemscbefore itself, 
so as to catalog the entire preliminary sketch of a whole system of 
metaphysics; because, regarding the first point, in a priori cognition 
nothing can be ascribed to the objectsd except what the thinking subject 
takes out of itself, and regarding the second, pure speculative reason is, 
in respect of principlese of cognition, a unity entirely separate and subsisting 
for itself, in which, as in an organized body, every part exists for 
the sake of all the others as all the others exist for its sake, and no principle! 
can be taken with certainty in one relation unless it has at the

and at the same time they proved the invisible force (of Newtonian 
attraction) that binds the universel which would have remained forever 
undiscovered if Copernicus had not ventured, in a manner contradictory to 
the senses yet true, to seek for the observed movements not in the objects of 
the heavens but in their observer. In this Preface I propose the transformation 
in our way of thinking presented in criticismh merely as a hypothesis, 
analogous to that other hypothesis, only in order to draw our notice to the 
first attempts at such a transformation, which are always hypothetical, even 
though in the treatise itself it will be proved not hypothetically but rather 
apodictically from the constitution of our representations of space and time 
and from the elementary concepts of the understanding.

same time been investigated in its thoroughgoing relation to the entire 
use of pure reason. But then metaphysics also has the rare good fortune, 
enjoyed by no other rational science that has to do with objectsO (for 
logic deals only with the form of thinking in general), which is that if by 
this critique it has been brought onto the secure course of a science, 


then it can fully embrace the entire field of cognitions belonging to it 

Bxxiv and thus can complete its work and lay it down for posterity as a principal 
frameworkb that can never be enlarged, since it has to do solely with 
principlesc and the limitations on their use, which are determined by the 
principles themselves. Hence as a fundamental science, metaphysics is 
also bound to achieve this completeness, and we must be able to say of 
it: nil actum reputans, si quid superesset agendum. d 
But it will be asked: What sort of treasure is it that we intend to leave 
to posterity, in the form of a metaphysics that has been purified through 
criticism but thereby also brought into a changeless state?e On a cursory 
overview of this work, one might believe that one perceives it to be only 
of negative utility, teaching us never to venture with speculative reason 
beyond the boundaries of experience; and in fact that is its first usefulness. 
But this utility soon becomes positive when we become aware 
that the principles with which speculative reason ventures beyond its 
boundaries do not in fact result in extending our use of reason, but 
rather, if one considers them more closely, inevitably result in narrowing 
it by threatening to extend the boundaries of sensibility, to which 
these principles really belong, beyond everything, and so even to dislodge 
the use of pure (practical) reason. Hence a critique that limits the 
speculative use of reason is, to be sure, to that extent negative, but because 
it simultaneously removes an obstacle that limits or even threatens 
to wipe out the practical use of reason, this critique is also in fact of 
positive and very important utility, as soon as we have convinced ourselves 
that there is an absolutely necessary practical use of pure reason 
(the moral use), in which reason unavoidably extends itself beyond the 
boundaries of sensibility, without needing any assistance from speculative 
reason, but in which it must also be made secure against any counteraction 
from the latter, in order not to fall into contradiction with

itself. To deny that this service of criticisma is of any positive utility 
would be as much as to say that the police are of no positive utility because 
their chief business is to put a stop to the violence that citizens 
have to fear from other citizens, so that each can carry on his own affairs 
in peace and safety. '7 In the analytical part of the critique it is 
proved that space and time are only forms of sensible intuition, and 
therefore only conditions of the existence of the things as appearances, 
further that we have no concepts of the understanding and hence no elements 
for the cognition of things except insofar as an intuition can be BXXVl 
given corresponding to these concepts, consequently that we can have 
cognition of no object as a thing in itself, but only insofar as it is an objectb 
of sensible intuition, i.e. as an appearance; from which follows the 
limitation of all even possible speculative cognition of reason to mere 
objects of experience. Yet the reservation must also be well noted, that 
even if we cannot cognize these same objects as things in themselves, 
we at least must be able to think them as things in themselves.* For 
otherwise there would follow the absurd proposition that there is an appearance 
without anything that appears. Now if we were to assume that Bxxvii 
the distinction between things as objects of experience and the very 
same things as things in themselves, which our critique has made necessary, 
were not made at all, then the principle of causality, and hence 
the mechanism of nature in determining causality, would be valid of all 
things in general as efficient causes. I would not be able to say of one 
and the same thing, e.g., the human soul, that its will is free and yet that 
it is simultaneously subject to natural necessity, i.e., that it is not free, 
without falling into an obvious contradiction; because in both propositions 
I would have taken the soul in just the same meaning," namely

i.e., as long as my concept is a possible thought, even if I cannot give any assurance 
whether or not there is a corresponding object' somewhere within the 
sum total of all possibilities. But in order to ascribe objective validity to such a 
concept (real possibility, for the first sort of possibility was merely logical) 
something more is required. This "more," however, need not be sought in theoretical 
sources of cognition; it may also lie in practical ones.

could not have taken it otherwise. But if the critique has not erred in 
teaching that the objecta should be taken in a twofold meaning, 
namely as appearance or as thing in itself;'8 if its deduction of the pure 
concepts of the understanding is correct, and hence the principle of 
causality applies only to things taken in the first sense, namely insofar 
as they are objects of experience, while things in the second meaning 
are not subject to it; then just the same will is thought of in the appearance 
(in visible actions) as necessarily subject to the law of nature and 
to this extent not free, while yet on the other hand it is thought of 
as belonging to a thing in itself as not subject to that law, and hence 
free, without any contradiction hereby occurring. Now although I cannot 
cognize my soul, considered from the latter side, through any speculative 
reason (still less through empirical observation), and hence I 
cannot cognize freedom as a property of any being to which I ascribe 
effects in the world of sense, because then I would have to cognize such 
an existence as determined, and yet not as determined in time (which is 
impossible, since I cannot support my concept with any intuition), nevertheless, 
I can think freedom to myself, i.e., the representation of it at 
least contains no contradiction in itself, so long as our critical distinction 
prevails between the two ways of representing (sensible and intellectual), 
along with the limitation of the pure concepts of the understanding 
arising from it, and hence that of the principles flowing from 
them. Now suppose that morality necessarily presupposes freedom (in 
the strictest sense) as a property of our will, citing a priori as data for 
this freedom certain original practical principles lying in our reason, 
which would be absolutely impossible without the presupposition of 
freedom, yet that speculative reason had proved that freedom cannot be 
thought at all, then that presupposition, namely the moral one, would 
necessarily have to yield to the other one, whose opposite contains an 
obvious contradiction; consequently freedom and with it morality (for 
the latter would contain no contradiction if freedom were not already 
presupposed) would have to give way to the mechanism of nature. But 
then, since for morality I need nothing more than that freedom should 
not contradict itself, that it should at least be thinkable that it should 
place no hindrance in the way of the mechanism of nature in the same 
action (taken in another relation), without it being necessary for me to 
have any further insight into it: the doctrine of morality asserts its place 
and the doctrine of nature its own, which, however, would not have occurred 
if criticism had not first taught us of our unavoidable ignorance 
in respect of the things in themselves and limited everything that we 
can cognize theoretically to mere appearances. Just the same sort of exposition 
of the positive utility of critical principles of pure reason can be 


a Object 


116 


to the second edition <B> 

given in respect to the concepts of God and of the simple nature of 
our soul, which, however, I forgo for the sake of brevity. Thus I cannot 
even assume God, freedom and immortality for the sake of the nec-BXXX 
essary practical use of my reason unless I simultaneously deprive speculative 
reason of its pretension to extravagant insights; because in order 
to attain to such insights, speculative reason would have to help itself to 
principles that in fact reach only to objects of possible experience, and 
which, if they were to be applied to what cannot be an object of experience, 
then they would always actually transform it into an appearance, 
and thus declare all practical extension of pure reason to be impossible. 
Thus I had to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith; 
and the dogmatism of metaphysics, i.e., the prejudice that without criticism 
reason can make progress in metaphysics, is the true source of all 
unbelief conflicting with morality, which unbelief is always very dogmatic. 
-Thus even if it cannot be all that difficult to leave to posterity 
the legacy of a systematic metaphysics, constructed according to the critique 
of pure reason, this is still a gift deserving of no small respect; to 
see this, we need merely to compare the culture of reason that is set on 
the course of a secure science with reason's unfounded groping and frivolous 
wandering about without critique, or to consider how much bet-Bxxxi 
ter young people hungry for knowledge might spend their time than in 
the usual dogmatism that gives so early and so much encouragement to 
their complacent quibbling about things they do not understand, and 
things into which neither they nor anyone else in the world will ever 
have any insight, or even encourages them to launch on the invention 
of new thoughts and opinions, and thus to neglect to learn the wellgrounded 
sciences; but we see it above all when we take account of the 
way criticism puts an end for all future time to objections against morality 
and religion in a Socratic way, namely by the clearest proof of the 
ignorance of the opponent. For there has always been some metaphysics 
or other to be met with in the world, and there will always continue 
to be one, and with it a dialectic of pure reason, because dialectic 
is natural to reason. Hence it is the first and most important occupation 
of philosophy to deprive dialectic once and for all of all disadvantageous 
influence, by blocking off the source of the errors. 

With this important alteration in the field of the sciences, and with 
the loss of its hitherto imagined possessions that speculative reason 
must suffer, everything yet remains in the same advantageous state as it 
was before concerning the universal human concern and the utility that Bxxxii 
the world has so far drawn from the doctrines of pure reason, and the 
loss touches only the monopoly of the schools and in no way the interest 
of human beings. I ask the most inflexible dogmatist whether

simplicity of substance, or the proof of freedom of the will against uni

versal mechanism drawn from the subtle though powerless distinctions 
between subjective and objective practical necessity, or the proof of the 
existence of God drawn from the concept of a most real being (or from 
the contingency of what is alterable and the necessity of a first mover), 
have ever, after originating in the schools, been able to reach the public 
or have the least influence over its convictions? If that has never happened, 
and if it can never be expected to happen, owing to the 
unsuitability of the common human understanding for such subtle 
speculation; if rather the conviction that reaches the public, insofar 
as it rests on rational grounds, had to be effected by something 
else -namely, as regards the first point, on that remarkable predisposition 
of our nature, noticeable to every human being, never to be capable 
of being satisfied by what is temporal (since the temporal is always 
insufficient for the predispositions of our whole vocation) leading to the 
hope of a future life; in respect of the second point, the mere clear ex-

BXXXlll 
position of our duties in opposition to all claims of the inclinations lead


ing to the consciousness of freedom; and finally, touching on the third 

point, the splendid order, beauty, and providence shown forth every


where in nature leading to the faith in a wise and great author of the 

world -then this possession not only remains undisturbed, but it even 

gains in respect through the fact that now the schools are instructed to 

pretend to no higher or more comprehensive insight on any point 

touching the universal human concerns than the insight that is accessi


ble to the great multitude (who are always most worthy of our respect), 

and to limit themselves to the cultivation of those grounds of proof 

alone that can be grasped universally and are sufficient from a moral 

standpoint. The alteration thus concerns only the arrogant claims of 

the schools, which would gladly let themselves be taken for the sole ex


perts and guardians of such truths (as they can rightly be taken in many 

other parts of knowledge), sharing with the public only the use of such 

truths, while keeping the key to them for themselves (quod mecum nescit, 

salus vult scire videri). a Yet care is taken for a more equitable claim on the 

Bxxxiv part of the speculative philosopher. He remains the exclusive trustee of 
a science that is useful to the public even without their knowledge, 
namely the critique of reason; for the latter can never become popular, 
but also has no need of being so; for just as little as the people want to 
fill their heads with fine-spun arguments for useful truths, so just as little 
do the equally subtle objections against these truths ever enter their 
minds; on the contrary, because the school inevitably falls into both, as 
does everyone who raises himself to speculation, the critique of reason 

a "What he knows nomore than I, he alone wants to seem to know." The correct quotation 
is "Quod mecum ignorat, solus volt scire videl'i" (What is unknown to me, that alone 
he wants to seem to know) (Horace, Epistles 2.1.87).

is bound once and for all to prevent, by a fundamental investigation of 
the rights of speculative reason, the scandal that sooner or later has to 
be noticed even among the people in the disputes in which, in the absence 
of criticism, metaphysicians (and among these in the end even 
clerics) inevitably involve themselves, and in which they afterwards 
even falsify their own doctrines. Through criticism alone can we sever 
the very root of materialism, fatalism, atheism, of freethinking unbelief, 
of enthusiasm and superstition, which can become generally 
injurious, and finally also of idealism and skepticism, which are more 
dangerous to the schools and can hardly be transmitted to the public. If 
governments find it good to concern themselves with the affairs of BXXXV 
scholars, then it would accord better with their wise solicitude both for 
the sciences and for humanity if they favored the freedom of such a critique, 
by which alone the treatments of reason can be put on a firm 
footing, instead of supporting the ridiculous despotism of the schools, 
which raise a loud cry of public danger whenever someone tears apart 
their cobwebs, of which the public has never taken any notice, and 
hence the loss of which it can also never feel. 

Criticism is not opposed to the dogmatic procedure of reason in its 
pure cognition as science (for science must always be dogmatic, i.e., it 
must prove its conclusions strictly a priori from secure principles)a; 
rather, it is opposed only to dogmatism, i.e., to the presumption of getting 
on solely with pure cognition from (philosophical) concepts according 
to principles,b which reason has been using for a long time 
without first inquiring in what way and by what right it has obtained 
them. Dogmatism is therefore the dogmatic procedure of pure reason, 
without an antecedent critique of its own capacity/This opposition 
therefore must not be viewed as putting in a good word for that loquacious 
shallowness under the presumed name of popularity, or even of 
skepticism, which gives short shrift to all metaphysics; rather, criticism BXXXVI 
is the preparatory activity necessary for the advancement of metaphysics 
as a well-grounded science, which must necessarily be dogmatic, 
carried out systematically in accordance with the strictest requirement, 
hence according to scholastic rigor (and not in a popular 
way); for this requirement is one that it may not neglect, since it undertakes 
to carry out its business wholly a priori and thus to the full satisfaction 
of speculative reason. In someday carrying out the plan that 
criticism prescribes, i.e., in the future system of metaphysics, we will 
have to follow the strict method of the famous Wolff, the greatest 
among all dogmatic philosophers, who gave us the first example (an ex-

ample by which he became the author of a spirit of well-groundedness 
in Germany that is still not extinguished) of the way in which the secure 
course of a science is to be taken, through the regular ascertainment of 
the principles,a the clear determination of concepts, the attempt at 
strictness in the proofs, and the prevention of audacious leaps in inferences; 
for these reasons he had the skills for moving a science such as 
metaphysics into this condition, if only it had occurred to him to prepare 
the field for it by a critique of the organ, namely pure reason itself: 

Bxxxvii a lack that is to be charged not so much to him as to the dogmatic way 
of thinking prevalent in his age; and for this the philosophers of his as 
of all previous times have nothing for which to reproach themselves. 
Those who reject his kind of teaching and simultaneously the procedure 
of the critique of pure reason can have nothing else in mind except 
to throw off the fetters of science altogether, and to transform work 
into play, certainty into opinion, and philosophy into philodoxy. 


Concerning this second edition, I have wanted, as is only proper, 
not to forgo the opportunity to remove as far as possible those difficulties 
and obscurities from which may have sprung several misunderstandings 
into which acute men, perhaps not without some fault on my 
part, have fallen in their judgment of this book. I have found nothing to 
alter either in the propositions themselves or in their grounds of proof, 
or in the form and completeness of the book's plan; this is to be ascribed 
partly to the long period of scrutiny to which I subjected them prior to 
laying it before the public; and partly to the constitution of the matter 
itself, namely to the nature of a pure speculative reason, which contains 
a truly articulated structure of members in which each thing is an organ, 
that is, in which everything is for the sake of each member, and each 


Bxxxviii individual member is for the sake of all, so that even the least frailty, 
whether it be a mistake (an error) or a lack, must inevitably betray itself 
in its use. I hope this system will henceforth maintain itself in this unalterability. 
It is not self-conceit that justifies my trust in this, but rather 
merely the evidence drawn from the experiment showing that the result 
effected is the same whether we proceed from the smallest elements to 
the whole of pure reason or return from the whole to every part (for this 
whole too is given in itself through the final intention of pure reason in 
the practical); while the attempt to alter even the smallest part directly 
introduces contradictions not merely into the system, but into universal 
human reason. Yet in the presentation there is still much to do, and 
here is where I have attempted to make improvements in this edition, 
which should remove first, the misunderstanding of the Aesthetic, 
chiefly the one in the concept of time; second, the obscurity in the

lack of sufficient evidence in the proofs of the Principles of Pure 
Understanding, and finally the misinterpretation of the paralogisms advanced 
against rational psychology. My revisionsI9 of the mode of pre


sentation* extend only to this point (namely, only to the end of the first 
chapter of the Transcendental Dialectic) and no further, because time BXXXlX 

* The only thing I can really call a supplement, and that only in the way of proof, BXXXIX 
is what I have said at [B]2 73 in the form of a new refutation of psychological 
idealism, and a strict proof (the only possible one, I believe) of the objective 
reality of outer intuition. No matter how innocent idealism may be held to be 
as regards the essential ends of metaphysics (though in fact it is not so innocent), 
it always remains a scandal of philosophy and universal human reason 
that the existence of things outside us (from which we after all get the whole 
matter for our cognitions, even for our inner sense) should have to be assumed 
merely on faith, and that if it occurs to anyone to doubt it, we should be unable 
to answer him with a satisfactory proof. Because there are some obscurities 
in the expressions of this proof between the third and sixth lines, I ask leave 
to alter this passage as follows: "But this persisting element cannot be an 
intuition in me. For all the determining grounds of my existence that can 
be encountered in me are representations, and as such they themselves 
need something persisting distinct from them, in relation to which their 
change, and thus my existence in the time in which they change, can be 
determined." Against this proof one will perhaps say: I am immediately conscious 
to myself only of what is in me, i.e., of my representation of external 
things; consequently it still remains undecided whether there is something 
outside me corresponding to it or not. Yet I am conscious through inner ex-Bxl 
perience ofmy existence in time (and consequently also of its determinability 
in time), and this is more than merely being conscious of my representation; 
yet it is identical with the empirical consciousness of my existence, which 
is only determinable through a relation to something that, while being bound 
up with my existence, is outside me. This consciousness of my existence in 
time is thus bound up identically with the consciousness of a relation to something 
outside me, and so it is experience and not fiction, sense and not imagination, 
that inseparably joins the outer with my inner sense; for outer sense is 
already in itself a relationa of intuition to something actual outside me; and its 
reality; as distinct from imagination, rests only on the fact that it is inseparably 
bound up with inner experience itself, as the condition of its possibility, which 
happens here. If I could combine a determination of my existence through intellectual 
intuition simultaneously with the intellectual consciousness of 
my existence, in the representation I am, which accompanies all my judgments 
and actions of my understanding, then no consciousness of a relationb to something 
outside me would necessarily belong to this. But now that intellectual 
consciousness does to be sure precede, but the inner intuition, in which alone

Preface 

Bxl was too short, and also in respect of the rest of the book no misunder


standing on the part of expert and impartial examiners has come my 
Bxli way, whom I have not been able to name with the praise due to them; 

Bxlii but the attention I have paid to their reminders will be evident to them 
in the appropriate passages. This improvement, however, is bound up 
with a small loss for the reader, which could not be guarded against 
without making the book too voluminous: namely, various things that 
are not essentially required for the completeness of the whole had to 
be omitted or treated in an abbreviated fashion, despite the fact that 
some readers may not like doing without them, since they could still 
be useful in another respect; only in this way could I make room for 
what I hope is a more comprehensible presentation, which fundamentally 
alters absolutely nothing in regard to the propositions or even 
their grounds of proof, but which departs so far from the previous edition 
in the method of presentation that it could not be managed 
through interpolations. This small loss, which in any case can be 
compensated for, if anyone likes, by comparing the first and second 


my existence can be determined, is sensible, and is bound to a condition of


time; however, this determination, and hence inner experience itself, depends 

on something permanent, which is not in me, and consequently must be out-

a xli side me, and I must consider myself in relationa to it; thus for an experience in 
general to be possible, the reality of outer sense is necessarily bound up with 
that of inner sense, i.e., I am just as certainly conscious that there are things 
outside me to which my sensibility relates, as I am conscious that I myself exist 
determined in time. Now which given intuitions actually correspond to outer 
objects, which therefore belong to outer sense, to which they are to be ascribed 
rather than to the imagination -that must be decided in each particular 
case according to the rules through which experience in general (even inner 
experience) is to be distinguished from imagination; which procedure is 
grounded always on the proposition that there actually is outer experience. To 
this the following remark can be added: The representation of something persisting 
in existence is not the same as a persisting representation; for that 
can be quite variable and changeable, as all our representations are, even the 
representations of matter, while still being related to something permanent, 
which must therefore be a thing distinct from all my representations and external, 
the existence of which is necessarily included in the determination of 
my own existence, which with it constitutes only a single experience, which 
could not take place even as inner if it were not simultaneously (in part) outer. 
The "How?" of this can be no more explained than we can explain further how 
we can think at all of what abides in time, whose simultaneity with what 
changes is what produces the concept of alteration.

editions, is, as I hope, more than compensated for by greater comprehensibility. 
In various public writings (partly in the reviews of some 
books, partly in special treatises) I have perceived with gratitude and 
enjoyment that the spirit of well-groundedness has not died out in 
Germany, but has only been drowned out for a short time by the fash-Bxliii 
ionable noise of a freedom of thought that fancies itself ingenious, and 
I see that the thorny paths of criticism, leading to a science of pure reason 
that is scholastically rigorous but as such the only lasting and 
hence the most necessary science, has not hindered courageous and 
clear minds from mastering them. To these deserving men, who combine 
well-groundedness of insight so fortunately with the talent for a 
lucid presentation (something I am conscious of not having myself), I 
leave it to complete my treatment, which is perhaps defective here and 
there in this latter regard. For in this case the danger is not that I will 
be refuted, but that I will not be understood. For my own part, from 
now on I cannot let myself become involved in controversies, although 
I shall attend carefully to all hints, whether they come from friends or 
from opponents, so that I may utilize them, in accordance with this 
propaedeutic, in the future execution of the system. Since during these 
labors I have come to be rather advanced in age (this month I will attain 
my sixty-fourth year), I must proceed frugally with my time ifo! am 
to carry out my plan of providing the metaphysics both of nature and 
of morals, as confirmation of the correctness of the critique both of 
theoretical and practical reason; and I must await the illumination of 
those obscurities that are hardly to be avoided at the beginning of this Bxliv 
work, as well as the defense of the whole, from those deserving men 
who have made it their own. Any philosophical treatise may find itself 
under pressure in particular passages (for it cannot be as fully armored 
as a mathematical treatise), while the whole structure of the system, 
considered as a unity, proceeds without the least danger; when a system 
is new, few have the adroitness of minda to gain an overview of it, 
and because all innovation is an inconvenience to them, still fewer have 
the desire to do so. Also, in any piece of writing apparent contradictions 
can be ferreted out if individual passages are torn out of their 
context and compared with each other, especially in a piece of informal 
discourseb that in the eyes of those who rely on the judgment of others 
cast a disadvantageous light On that piece of writing but that can be 
very easily resolved by someone who has mastered the idea of the 
whole. Meanwhile, if a theory is really durable, then in time the effect

of action and reaction, which at first seemed to threaten it with great 
danger, will serve only to polish away its rough spots, and if men of impartiality, 
insight, and true popularity make it their business to do this, 
then in a short time they will produce even the required elegance.

The idea of transcendental philosophy. 
Experience is without doubt the first product that our understanding

brings forth as it works on the raw material of sensible sensations. 1 It is 
for this very reason the first teaching, and in its progress it is so inexhaustible 
in new instruction that the chain of life in all future generations 
will never have any lack of new information that can be gathered 
on this terrain. Nevertheless it is far from the only field to which our 
understanding can be restricted. It tells us, to be sure, what is, but never 
that it must necessarily be thus and not otherwise.c For that very reason 
it gives us no true universality, and reason, which is so desirous of this 
kind of cognitions, is more stimulated than satisfied by it. Now such A 2 
universal cognitions, which at the same time have the character of inner 
necessity, must be clear and certain for themselves, independently of experience; 
hence one calls them apriori cognitions:2 whereas that which 
is merely borrowed from experience is, as it is put, cognized only aposteriori, 
or empirically) 

a We first present the introduction as it appeared in the first edition, followed by the revised 
version that appeared in the second edition. Considerable changes were made in 
the latter, including some deletions, major additions, and occasional alterations within 
the passages that were repeated. We will use notes and references to the marginal pagination 
to show what changes were made from the first to the second editions. The following 
two paragraphs in the first edition were replaced with the first two numbered 
sections of the second. 

b In his copy of the first edition, Kant made the following two notes: 
"1. On the possibility of a critique of pure reason. 

2. On its necessity (not from other sciences). 
3. On its division. 
4-On its purpose, the science of all principles [Principien] of pure reason. (Practical)" 
(E I, p. 12). 
"That reason has its boundaries with regard to its apriori principles [Principien], concerning 
both degree and scope. 
Division of metaphysics into metaphysics of nature and of morals" (E II, p. 12). 

, The following note is added in Kant's copy of the first edition: 
"We cannot infer to any necessity aposteriori if we do not already have a rule a priori. 
E.g., 'If many cases are identical, there must be something that makes this agreement 
necessary' presupposes the apriori proposition that everything contingent has a cause 
that determines its concept a priori." (E IV, p. 14)

Introduction <A> 


Now what is especially remarkable is that even among our experiences 
cognitions are mixed in that must have their origin a priori and 
that perhaps serve only to establish connection among our representations 
of the senses. For if one removes from our experiences everything 
that belongs to the senses, there still remain certain original 
concepts and the judgments generated from them, which must have 
arisen entirely a priori, independently of experience, because they 
make one able to say more about the objects that appear to the senses 
than mere experience would teach, or at least make one believe that 
one can say this, and make assertions contain true universality and 
strict necessity, the likes of which merely empirical cognition can 
never afford. 

B 6 But what says still more is this, that certain cognitions even aban


A 3 don the field of all possible experiences, and seem to expand the domain 
of our judgments beyond all bounds of experience through 
concepts to which no corresponding object at all can be given in 
expenence. 
And precisely in these latter cognitions, which go beyond the world 
of the senses, where experience can give neither guidance nor correction, 
lie the investigations of our reason that we hold to be far more 

B 7 preeminent in their importance and sublime in their final aim than 
everything that the understanding can learn in the field of appearances, 
and on which we would rather venture everything, even at the risk of 
erring, than give up such important investigations because of any sort 
of reservation or from contempt and indifference. a 

Now it may seem natural that as soon as one has abandoned the terrain 
of experience, one would not immediately erect an edifice with 
cognitions that one possesses without knowing whence, and on the 
credit of principles whose origin one does not know, without having 
first assured oneself of its foundation through careful investigations, 
thus that one would have long since raised the question how the understanding 
could come to all these cognitions a priori and what doA4 
main, validity, and value they might have. And in fact nothing is more 
natural, if one understands by this word that which properly and 
B8 reasonably ought to happen; but if one understands by it that which 
usually happens, then conversely nothing is more natural and comprehensible 
than that this investigation should long have been neglected. 
For one part of these cognitions, the mathematical, has long been reliable, 
and thereby gives rise to a favorable expectation about others 
as well, although these may be of an entirely different nature. Fur


a Here the second edition adds two sentences characterizing the tasks of pure reason. See 
B7 below.

Introduction <A> 

thermore, if one is beyond the circle of experience, then one is sure not 
to be contradicted through experience. The charm in expanding one's 
cognitions is so great that one can be stopped in one's progress only by 
bumping into a clear contradiction. This, however, one can avoid if 
one makes his inventions carefully, even though they are not thereby 
inventions any the less. Mathematics gives us a splendid example of 
how far we can go with a priori cognition independently of experience. 
Now it is occupied, to be sure, with objects and cognitions only so far 
as these can be exhibited in intuition. This circumstance, however, is 
easily overlooked, since the intuition in question can itself be given a 
priori, and thus can hardly be distinguished from a mere pure concept. 
Encouraged by such a proof of the power of reason, the drive for ex-AS 
pansion sees no bounds. The light dove, in free flight cutting through 
the air the resistance of which it feels, could get the ideaa that it could 
do even better in airless space. Likewise, Plato abandoned the world of B9 
the senses because it posed so many hindrances for the understanding, 
and dared to go beyond it on the wings of the ideas, in the empty space 
of pure understanding. He did not notice that he made no headway by 
his efforts, for he had no resistance, no support, as it were, by which he 
could stiffen himself, and to which he could apply his powers in order 
to get his understanding off the ground. It is, however, a customary 
fate of human reason in speculation to finish its edifice as early as 
possible and only then to investigate whether the ground has been 
adequately prepared for it. But at that point all sorts of excuses will 
be sought to assure us of its sturdiness or to refuse such a late and 
dangerous examination. What keeps us free of all worry and suspicion 
during the construction, however, and flatters us with apparent 
thoroughness, is this. A great part, perhaps the greatest part of the 
business of our reason consists in analyses of the concepts that we already 
have of objects. This affords us a multitude of cognitions that, 
though they are nothing more than illuminations or clarifications of 
that which is already thought in our concepts (though still in a con-A6 
fused way), are, at least as far as their form is concerned, treasured as 
if they were new insights, though they do not extend the concepts that 
we have in either matter or content but only set them apart from each 
other. Now since this procedure does yield a real a priori cognition, B IO 
which makes secure and useful progress, reason, without itself noticing 
it, under these pretenses surreptitiously makes assertions of quite another 
sort, in which it adds something entirely alien to given concepts 
a priori, without one knowing how it was able to do this and without 
this question even being allowed to come to mind. I will therefore deal 


a Vorstellung 
129 



Introduction <A> 


with the distinction between these two kinds of cognition right at the 
outset.a 


On the difference between analytic and 
synthetic judgments.4 

In all judgments in which the relation of a subject to the predicate is 
thought (if! consider only affirmative judgments, since the application 
to negative ones is easy), this relation is possible in two different ways. 
Either the predicate B belongs to the subject A as something that is 
(covertly) contained in this concept A; or B lies entirely outside the 
conceptA, though to be sure it stands in connection with it. In the first 
case I call the judgment analytic, in the second synthetic. Analytic 
A7 judgments (affirmative ones) are thus those in which the connection of 
the predicate is thought through identity, but those in which this connection 
is thought without identity are to be called synthetic judg-

B I I ments. One could also call the former judgments of clarification and 
the latter judgments of amplification,b since through the predicate the 
former do not add anything to the concept of the subject, but only 
break it up by means of analysis into its component concepts, which 
were already thought in it (though confusedly); while the latter, on the 
contrary, add to the concept of the subject a predicate that was not 
thought in it at all, and could not have been extracted from it through 
any analysis; e.g., if! say: "All bodies are extended," then this is an analytic 
judgment. For I do not need to go outside the conceptC that I 
combine with the word "body" in order to find that extension is connected 
with it, but rather I need only to analyze that concept, i.e., become 
conscious of the manifold that I always think in it, in order to 
encounter this predicate therein; it is therefore an analytic judgment. 
On the contrary, if I say: "All bodies are heavy," then the predicate is 
something entirely different from that which I think in the mere concept 
of a body in general. The addition of such a predicate thus yields 
a synthetic judgment. 
"Now from this it is clear: I 
) that through analytic judgments our 
A8 cognition is not amplified at all, but rather the concept, which I already

judgments." (E V, p. 14) 

b Erliiuterungs-and Erweiterung.mrteile. These terms are emphasized in the second but not 
in the first edition. 
, Kant's copy of the first edition here adds: " 'I exist' is an analytic judgment; 'A body exists' 
is a synthetic one." (E VI, p. 14) 
d The next two paragraphs are replaced with a single one in the second edition, the second 
of which incorporates part of the present one; see B I I-12 below.

Introduction <A> 

have, is set out, and made intelligible to me; 2) that in synthetic judgments 
I must have in addition to the concept of the subject something 
else eX) on which the understanding depends in cognizing a predicate 
that does not lie in that concept as nevertheless belonging to it.a 

In the case of empirical judgments or judgments of experience there 
is no difficulty here.boFor this X is the complete experience of the object 
that I think through some concept A, which constitutes only a part of 
this experience. For althoughC I do not at all include the predicate of B 12 
weight in the concept of a body in general, the concept nevertheless 
designates the complete experience through a part of it, to which I can 
therefore add still other parts of the very same experience as belonging 
to the former. I can first cognize the concept of body analytically 
through the marks of extension, of impenetrability, of shape, etc., which 
are all thought in this concept. But now I amplify my cognition and, in 
looking back to the experience from which I had extracted this concept 
of body, I find that weight is also always connected with the previous 
marks.d Experience is therefore that X that lies outside the concept A 
and on which the possibility of the synthesis of the predicate of weight 
B with the concept A is grounded. 

But in synthetic a priori judgments this means of help is entirely lack-A9 
ing.5 If I am to go outside the concept A in order to cognize another B B 13 
as combined with it, what is it on which I depend and through which 
the synthesis becomes possible, since I here do not have the advantage 
ofolooking around for it in the field of experience? Take the proposition: 
"Everything that happens has its cause." In the concept of something 
that happens, I think, to be sure, of an existence which was preceded by 
a time, etc., and from that analytic judgments can be drawn. But the 
concept of a cause indicates something different from the concept of 
something that happens, and is not contained in the latter representation 
at all. How then do I come to say something quite different about 
that which happens in general, and to cognize the concept of cause as 
belonging to it even though not contained in it?" What is the X here on 
which the understanding depends when it believes itself to discover beyond 
the concept of A a predicate that is foreign to it and that is yet 

a Kant's copy of the first edition adds here: "Analytic judgments could accordingly be 
called mere judgments of clarification, synthetic judgments, however, judgments of amplification." 
(E VII, p. 15) 

b In Kant's copy of the first edition, this was changed to: "In the case of empirical judgments 
or judgments of experience there is no difficulty about how they are to be proved 
synthetically." (E VIII, p. 15) 

C From here the remainder of the paragraph is incorporated into the second edition. 
d The remainder of this paragraph is changed in the second edition; see B I 2. 
, Kant ends this and the next sentence with periods, for which we have substituted ques


tion marks.

Introduction <A> 

connected with it? It cannot be experience, for the principle that has 
been adduced adds the latter representations to the former not only 
with greater generality than experience can provide, but also with the 
expression of necessity, hence entirely a priori and from mere concepts. 

'"1\10 Now the entire final aim of our speculative a priori cognition rests on 
such synthetic, i.e., ampliative, principles; for the analytic ones are, to 
be sure, most important and necessary, but only for attaining that distinctness 
of concepts that is requisite for a secure and extended synthesis 
as a really new construction.a 


bA certain mystery thus lies hidden here,* the elucidation of which 
alone can make progress in the boundless field of pure cognition of the 
understanding secure and reliable: namely, to uncover the 􀇽round of the 
possibility of synthetic a priorijudgments with appropriate generality, to 
gain insight into the conditions that make every kind of them possible, 
and not merely to designate this entire cognition (which comprises its 
own species) in a cursory outline, but to determine it completely and 
adequately for every use in a system in accordance with its primary 
sources, divisions, domain, and boundaries. So much provisionally for 
the pecularities of synthetic judgments. 

B 24 cNow from all of this there results the idea of a special science, which 

A I I could serve for the critique of pure reason. Every cognition is called 
pure, however, that is not mixed with anything foreign to it. But a cognition 
is called absolutely pure, in particular, in which no experience or 
sensation at all is mixed in, and that is thus fully a priori. Now reason is 
the faculty that provides the principlesd of cognition a priori. Hence 
pure reason is that which contains the principlese for cognizing something 
absolutely a priori. An organon of pure reason would be a sum 

B 25 total of those principles! in accordance with which all pure a priori cog


* If it had occurred to one of the ancients even to raise this question, this alone 
would have offered powerful resistance to all the systems of pure reason down 
to our own times, and would have spared us so many vain attempts that were 
blindly undertaken without knowledge of what was really at issue.

b The following paragraph, including the footnote, is omitted in the second edition, and

there is here inserted the section number VII and the ensuing heading. In addition, 
the second and third sentences of this paragraph are omitted, and there are minor 
changes in the wording of the opening and fourth sentences. See B 24 below.

nitions can be acquired and actually brought about. The exhaustive application 
of such an organon would create a system of pure reason. But 
since that requires a lot, and it is still an open question whether such an 
amplification of our cognition is possible at all and in what cases it 
would be possible, we can regard a science of the mere estimation of 
pure reason, of its sources and boundaries, as the propaedeutic to the 
system of pure reason. Such a thing would not be a doctrine, but must 
be called only a critique of pure reason, and its utility would really be 
only negative, serving not for the amplification but only for the purification 
of our reason, and for keeping it free of errors, by which a great 
deal is already won. I call all cognition transcendental that is occupied 
not so much with objects but rather with our a priori concepts of objects 
in general.a,6 A system of such concepts would be called transcendental A I 2 
philosophy. But this is again too much for the beginning. For since such 
a science would have to contain completely both analytic as well as synthetic 
a priori cognition, it is, as far as our aim is concerned, too broad 
in scope, since we need to take the analysis only as far as is indispensably 
necessary in order to provide insight into the principles of a priori 
synthesis in their entire scope, which is our only concern. This investi-B 26 
gation, which we can properly call not doctrine but only transcendental 
critique, since it does not aim at the amplification of the cognitions 
themselves but only at their correction, and is to supply the touchstone 
of the worth or worthlessness of all cognitions a priori, is that with 
which we are now concerned. Such a critique is accordingly a preparation, 
if possible, for an organon, and, if this cannot be accomplished, 
then at least for a canon, in accordance with which the complete system 
of the philosophy of pure reason, whether it is to consist in the amplification 
or the mere limitationb of its cognition, can in any case at least 
some day be exhibited both analytically and synthetically. For that this 
should be possible, indeed that such a system should not be too great in 
scope for us to hope to be able entirely to complete it, can be assessed 
in advance from the fact that our object is not the nature of things, 
which is inexhaustible, but the understanding, which judges about the A I 3 
nature of things, and this in turn only in regard to its a priori cognition, 
the supply of which, since we do not need to search for it externally, 
cannot remain hidden from us, and in all likelihood is small enough to 
be completely recorded, its worth or worthlessness assessed, and subjected 
to a correct appraisal.c

Transcendental philosophy is here only an idea,b for which the critique 
of pure reason is to outline the entire plan architectonically, i.e., 
from principles,' with a full guarantee for the completeness and certainty 
of all the components that comprise this edifice.d That this critique 
is not itself already called transcendental philosophy rests solely 
on the fact that in order to be a complete system it would also have to 
contain an exhaustive analysis of all of human cognition a priori. Now 
our critique must, to be sure, lay before us a complete enumeration of 
all of the ancestral conceptse that comprise the pure cogni;:ion in question. 
Only it properly refrains from the exhaustive analysis of these concepts 
themselves as well as from the complete review of all of those 
derived from them, partly because this analysis would not be purpose


AI4/BZ8 fullsince it does not contain the difficulty that is encountered in the 
synthesis on account of which the whole critique is actually undertaken, 
partly because it would be contrary to the unity of the plan to take on 
responsibility for the completeness of such an analysis and derivation, 
from which one could after all be relieved given one's aim. This completeness 
of the analysis as well as the derivation from the a priori concepts 
which are to be provided in the future will nevertheless be easy to 
complete as long as they are present as exhaustive principle􀇾 of synthesis, 
and if nothing is lacking in them in regard to this essential aim. 
To the critique of pure reason there accordingly belongs everything 
that constitutes transcendental philosophy, and it is the complete idea 
of transcendental philosophy, but is not yet this science itself, since it 
goes only so far in the analysis as is requisite for the complete estimation 
of synthetic a priori cognition. 
The chief target in the division of such a science is that absolutely no 
concepts must enter into it that contain anything empirical, or that the 
a priori cognition be entirely pure. Hence, although the supreme prin

ciples of morality and the fundamental concepts of it are a priori cognitions, 
they still do not belong in transcendental philosophy, since the A 15 
concepts of pleasure and displeasure, of desires and inclinations, of B 29 
choice, etc., which are all of empirical origin, must there be presupposed.
n Hence transcendental philosophy is a philosophyb of pure, 
merely speculative reason. For everything practical, insofar as it contains 
motives,c is related to feelings, which belong among empirical 
sources of cognition. 

Now if one wants to set up the division of this science from the general 
viewpoint of a system in general, then the one that we will now present 
must contain first a Doctrine of Elements and second a Doctrine 
of Method of pure reason. Each of these main parts will have its subdivision, 
the grounds for which cannot yet be expounded here. All that 
seems necessary for an introduction or a preliminary is that there are 
two stems of human cognition, which may perhaps arise from a common 
but to us unknown root, namely sensibility and understanding, 
through the first of which objects are given to us, but through the second 
of which they are thought. Now if sensibility were to contain a 
priori representations, which constitute the conditions under which ob-B 30 
jects are given to us, it would belong to transcendental philosophy. The 
transcendental doctrine of the senses will have to belong to the first part A 16 
of the science of elements, since the conditions under which alone the 
objects of human cognition are given precede those under which those 
objects are thought. 

n This sentence is revised in the second edition to reflect Kant's intervening argument, 
beginning with the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals of 1785, that the principle of 
morality if not its application is indeed entirely a priori. See B 28-9 below. 

b Weltweisheit 

, Bewegungsgriinde, replaced in the second edition with Triebfedern (incentives) in order to 
leave room for the idea that although incentives based on feelings are not adequate for 
morality, there can be other, more purely rational motives for it (see Groundw01·k, 

4:427).

BI Introductiona 

I.h 

On the difference between pure and empirical cognition. 

There is no doubt whatever that all our cognition begins with experience; 
for how else should the cognitive faculty be awakened into exercise 
if not through objects that stimulate our senses and in part 
themselves produce representations, in part bring the activity of our understanding 
into motion to compare these, to connect or separate them, 
and thus to work up the raw material of sensible impressions into a 
cognition of objects that is called experience?7 As far as time is concerned, 
then, no cognition in us precedes experience, and with experience 
every cognition begins. 

But although all our cognition commences with experience, yet it 
does not on that account all arise from experience. For it could well be 
that even our experiential cognition is a composite of that which we receive 
through impressions and that which our own cognitive faculty 
(merely prompted by sensible impressions) provides out of itself, 

B 2 which addition we cannot distinguish from that fundamental material 
until long practice has made us attentive to it and skilled in separating 
it out. 
It is therefore at least a question requiring closer investigation, and 
one not to be dismissed at first glance, whether there is any such cognition 
independent of all experience and even of all impressions of the 
senses. One calls such cognitions a priori,C and distinguishes them 
from empirical ones, which have their sources a posteriori, namely in 
experience.8 
The former expressiond is nevertheless not yet sufficiently determinate 
to designate the whole sense of the question before us. For it is customary 
to say of many a cognition derived from experiential sources that 
we are capable of it or partake in it a priori, because we do not derive it 

a As in the second edition.

immediately from experience, but rather from a general rule that we 
have nevertheless itself borrowed from experience. So one says of someone 
who undermined the foundation of his house that he could have 
known a priori that it would collapse, i.e., he need not have waited for 
the experience of it actually collapsing. Yet he could not have known this 
entirely a priori. 9 For that bodies are heavy and hence fall if their support 
is taken away must first have become known to him through experience. 

In the sequel therefore we will understand by a priori cognitions not 
those that occur independently of this or that experience, but rather 
those that occur absolutely independently of all experience. Opposed to B 3 
them are empirical cognitions, or those that are possible onl)"" a posteriori, 
i.e., through experience. Among a priori cognitions, however, those 
are called pure with which nothing empirical is intermixed. Thus, e.g., 
the proposition "Every alteration has its cause" is an a priori proposition, 
only not pure, since alteration is a concept that can be drawn only 
from experience. IO 


II. 


We are in possession of certain a priori cognitions, and 
even the common understanding is never without them. 


At issue here is a mark by means of which we can securely distinguish a 
pure cognition from an empirical one. II Experience teaches us, to be 
sure, that something is constituted thus and so, but not that it could not 
be otherwise. First, then, if a proposition is thought along with its necessity, 
it is an a priori judgment; if it is, moreover, also not derived 
from any proposition except one that in turn is valid as a necessary 
proposition, then it is absolutely a priori. Second: Experience never 
gives its judgments true or strict but only assumed and comparative 
universality (through induction), so properly it must be said: as far as 
we have yet perceived, there is no exception to this or that rule. Thus if B4 
a judgment is thought in strict universality, i.e., in such a way that no 
exception at all is allowed to be possible, then it is not derived from experience, 
but is rather valid absolutely a priori. Empirical universality is 
therefore only an arbitrary increase in validity from that which holds in 
most cases to that which holds in all, as in, e.g., the proposition "All 
bodies are heavy," whereas strict universality belongs to a judgment essentially; 
this points to a special source of cognition for it, namely a faculty 
of a priori cognition. Necessity and strict universality are therefore 
secure indicationsfl of an a priori cognition, and also belong together in-

separably. But since in their use it is sometimes easier to show the empiricalelimitation 
in judgments than the contingency in them, or is often 
more plausible to show the unrestricted universality that we ascribe to 
a judgment than its necessity, it is advisable to employ separately these 
two criteria, each of which is in itself infallible. 12 

Now it is easy to show that in human cognition there actually are 
such necessary and in the strictest sense universal, thus pure a priori 
judgments. If one wants an example from the sciences, one need only 
look at all the propositions of mathematics; if one would have one 
from the commonest use of the understanding, the proposition that 
every alteration must have a cause will do; indeed in the latter the very 
concept of a cause so obviously contains the concept of a necessity of 
connection with an effect and a strict universality of rule that it would 
be entirely lost if one sought, as Hume did, to derive it from a frequent 
association of that which happens with that which precedes and a habit 
(thus a merely subjective necessity) of connecting representations arising 
from that association.13 Even without requiring such examples for 
the proof of the reality of pure a priori principles in our cognition, one 
could establish their indispensability for the possibility of experience 
itself, thus establish it II priori. For where would experience itself get 
its certainty if all rules in accordance with which it proceeds were 
themselves in turn always empirical, thus contingent?; a hence one 
could hardly allow these to count as first principles. Yet here we can 
content ourselves with having displayed the pure use of our cognitive 
faculty as a fact together with its indication.b Not merely in judgments, 
however, but even in concepts is an origin of some of them revealed a 

priori. Gradually remove from your experiential concept of a body 
everything that is empirical in it -the color, the hardness or softness, 
the weight, even the impenetrability -there still remains the space 
that was occupied by the body (which has now entirely disappeared), 
and you cannot leave that out. Likewise, if you remove from your empirical 
concept of every object,' whether corporeal or incorporeal, all 
those properties of which experience teaches you, you could still not 
take from it that by means of which you think of it as a substance or 
as dependent on a substance (even though this concept contains more 
determination than that of an object! in general). Thus, convinced by 
the necessity with which this concept presses itself on you, you must 
concede that it has its seat in your faculty of cognition a priori.

Introduction <B> 

lILa 

Philosophy needs a science that determines the possibility, 
the principles,b and the domain of all cognitions a priori. 

But what says still more than all the foregoing' is this, that certain 
cognitions even abandon the field of all possible experiences, and seem A 3 
to expand the domain of our judgments beyond all bounds of experi


􀋋nce through concepts to which no corresponding object at all can be 
given in experience. 
And precisely in these latter cognitions, which go beyond the world 
of the senses, where experience can give neither guidance nor correction, 
lie the investigations of our reason that we hold to be far more 
preeminent in their importance and sublime in their final aim than B 7 
everything that the understanding can learn in the field of appearances, 
in which we would rather venture everything, even at the risk of erring, 
than give up such important investigations because of any sort of reservation 
or from contempt and indifference. dThese unavoidable problems 
of pure reason itself are God, freedom and immortality. But the 
science whose final aim in all its preparations is directed properly only 
to the solution of these problems is called metaphysics, whose procedure 
is in the beginning dogmatic, i.e., it confidently takes on the execution 
of this task without an antecedent examination of the capacity or 
incapacitye of reason for such a great undertaking. 

Now it may seem natural that as soon as one has abandoned the terrain 
of experience one would not immediately erect an edifice with cognitions 
that one possesses without knowing whence, and on the credit 
of principles whose origin one does not know, without having first assured 
oneself of its foundation through careful investigations, thus that 
one would all the morefhave long since raised the question how the understanding 
could come to all these cognitions a priori and what domain, 
validity, and value they might have. And in fact nothing is more A4 
natural, if one understands by the word naturalg that which properly 
and reasonably ought to happen; but if one understands by it that which B 8 
usually happens, then conversely nothing is more natural and compre

hensible than that this investigation should long have been neglected.a 
For one part of these cognitions, the mathematical, has long been reliable, 
and thereby gives rise to a favorable expectation about others as 
well, although these may be of an entirely different nature. Furthermore, 
if one is beyond the circle of experience, then one is sure of not 
being refutedb through experience. The charm in expanding one's cognitions 
is so great that one can be stopped in one's progress only by 
bumping into a clear contradiction. This, however, one can avoid if one 
makes his inventions carefully, even though they are not thereby inventions 
any the less. Mathematics gives us a splendid example of how far 
we can go with a priori cognition independently of experience. Now it 
is occupied, to be sure, with objects and cognitions only so far as these 
can be exhibited in intuitions. This circumstance, however, is easily 
overlooked, since the intuition in question can itself be given a priori, 
and thus can hardly be distinguished from a mere pure concept. 
CaptivatedC by such a proof of the power of reason, the drive for expansion 
sees no bounds. The light dove, in free flight cutting through 
the air the resistance of which it feels, could get the idead that it could 

B 9 do even better in airless space. Likewise, Plato abandoned the world of 
the senses because it set such narrow limitse for the understanding, and 
dared to go beyond it on the wings of the ideas, in the empty space of 
pure understanding. He did not notice that he made no headway by his 
efforts, for he had no resistance, no support, as it were, by which he 
could stiffen himself, and to which he could apply his powers in order 
to put his understanding into motion. It is, however, a customary fate 
of human reason in speculation to finish its edifice as early as possible 
and only then to investigate whether the ground has been adequately 
prepared for it. But at that point all sorts of excuses will be sought to assure 
us of its sturdiness or also, even better! to refuse such a late and 
dangerous examination. What keeps us free of all worry and suspicion 
during the construction, however, and flatters us with apparent thoroughness, 
is this. A great part, perhaps the greatest part, of the business 
ofour reason consists in analyses of the concepts that we already have of 
objects. This affords us a multitude of cognitions that, although they 
are nothing more than illuminations or clarifications of that which is al

least as far as their form is concerned, treasured as if they were new in-

sights, though they do not extend the concepts that we have in either 
matter or content, but only set them apart from each other. Now since B 10 
this procedure does yield a real a priori cognition, which makes secure 
and useful progress, reason, without itself noticing it, under these pretenses 
surreptitiously makes assertions of quite another sort, in which 
reason adds something entirely alien to given concepts and indeeda does 
so a priori, without one knowing how it was able to do this and without 
such ab question even being allowed to come to mind. I will therefore 
deal with the distinction between these two sorts of cognition right at 
the outset. 


Iv.c 

On the difference between analytic and 
synthetic judgments. 14 


In all judgments in which the relation of a subject to the predicate is 
thought (if I consider only affirmative judgments, since the application 
to negative ones is easy) this relation is possible in two different ways. 
Either the predicate B belongs to the subject A as something that is 
(covertly) contained in this concept A; or B lies entirely outside the con: 
ceptA, though to be sure it stands in connection with it. In the first case 
I call the judgment analytic, in the second synthetic. Analytic judg-A 7 
ments (affirmative ones) are thus those in which the connection of the 
predicate is thought through identity, but those in which this connection 
is thought without identity are to be called synthetic judgments. 
One could also call the former judgments of clarification, and the lat-B II 
ter judgments of amplification/ since through the predicate the former 
do not add anything to the concept of the subject, but only break 
it up by means of analysis into its component concepts, which were already 
thought in it (though confusedly); while the latter, on the contrary, 
add to the concept of the subject a predicate that was not thought 
in it at all, and could not have been extracted from it through any analysis. 
E.g., ifI say: "All bodies are extended," then this is an analytic judgment. 
For I do not need to go beyonde the concept that I combine with 
the body! in order to find that extension is connected with it, but rather 
I need only to analyze that concept, i.e., become conscious of the manifold 
that I always think in it, in order to encounter this predicate 
therein; it is therefore an analytic judgment. On the contrary, if I say:

Introduction <B> 

"All bodies are heavy," then the predicate is something entirely different 
from that which I think in the mere concept of a body in general. 
The addition of such a predicate thus yields a synthetic judgment. 

aJudgments of experience, as such, are all synthetic. For it would 
be absurd to ground an analytic judgment on experience, since I do not 
need to go beyond my concept at all in order to formulate the judgment, 
and therefore need no testimony from experience for that. That 
a body is extended is a proposition that is established a priori, and is not 
a judgment of experience. For before I go to experience, I already have 
all the conditions for my judgment in the concept, from which I merely 
draw out the predicate in accordance with the principle of contradiction, 
and can thereby at the same time become conscious of the necessity 
of the judgment, which experience could never teach me. On the 

A8 contrary, although I bdo not at all include the predicate of weight in the 
concept of a body in general, the concept nevertheless designates an object 
of experience' through a part of it, to which I can therefore add stilI 
other parts of the same experience as belonging with the former. I can 
first cognize the concept of body analytically through the marks of extension, 
of impenetrability, of shape, etc., which are all thought in this 
concept. But now I amplify my cognition and, looking back to the experience 
from which I had extracted this concept of body, I find that 
weight is also always connected with the previous marks, dand I therefore 
add this synthetically as predicate to that concept. It is thus experience 
Con which the possibility of the synthesis of the predicate of 
weight with the concept of body is grounded, since both concepts, 
though the one is not contained in the other, nevertheless belong together, 
though only contingently, as parts of a whole, namely experience, 
which is itself a synthetic combination of intuitions.

of which the synthesis becomes possible, since I here do not have the

something that happens, I think, to be sure, of an existence that was 
preceded by a time, etc., and from that analytic judgments can be 
drawn. But the concept of a cause lies entirely outside that concept, 
anda indicates something different than the concept of what happens in 
general, and is thereforeb not contained in the latter representation at 
all. How then do I come to say something quite different about that 
which happens in general, and to cognize the concept of cause as belonging 
to it, indeed necessarily,' even though not contained in it?d 
What is the unknown =eX here on which the understanding depends 
when it believes itself to discover beyond the concept of A a predicate 
that is foreign to it yet which it nevertheless believes to be connected 
with it?fIt cannot be experience, for the principle that has been adduced 
adds the latter representations to the former not only with greater generality 
than experience can provide, but also with the expression of necessity, 
hence entirely a priori and from mere concepts. Now the entire 
final aim of our speculative a priori cognition rests on such synthetic, A 10 
i.e., ampliative principles; for the analytic ones are, to be sure, most important 
and necessary, but only for attaining that distinctness of con-B 14

quired by the nature of any apodictic certainty), one was persuaded that 
the principles could also be cognized from the principlea of contradiction, 
in which, however, theyb erred; for a synthetic proposition can of 
course be comprehended in accordance with the principle of contradiction, 
but only insofar as another synthetic proposition is presupposed 
from which it can be deduced, never in itself. 

It must first be remarked that properly mathematical propositions are 
always a priori judgments and are never empirical, because they carry 
necessity with them, which cannot be derived from experience. But if 

B15 one does not want to concede this, well then, I will restrict myproposition 
to pure mathematics, the concept of which already implies that it 
does not contain empirical but merely pure a priori cognition. 
To be sure, one might initially think that the proposition "7 + 5 = I2" 


B16 
is a merely analytic proposition that follows from the concept of a sum 
of seven and five in accordance with the principle of contradiction. Yet 
if one considers it more closely, one finds that the concept of the sum 
of 7 and 5 contains nothing more than the unification of both numbers 
in a single one, through which it is not at all thought what this single 
number is which comprehends the two of them. The concept of twelve 
is by no means already thought merely by my thinking of that unification 
of seven and five, and no matter how long I analyze my concept of 
such a possible sum I will still not find twelve in it. One must go beyond 
these concepts, seeking assistance in the intuition that corresponds to 
one of the two, one's five fingers, say, or (as in Segner's arithmetic)!7 five 
points, and one after another add the units of the five given in the intuition 
to the concept of seven. cFor I take first the number 7, and, as I 
take the fingers of my hand as an intuition for assistance with the concept 
of 5, to that image of mine I now add the units that I have previously 
taken together in order to constitute the number 5 one after 
another to the number 7, and thus see the number I2 arise. That 7 
should be added to 5 I have, to be sure, thought in the concept of a sum 

= 

7 + 5, but not that this sum is equal to the number I 2. The arithmetical 
proposition is therefore always synthetic; one becomes all the 
more distinctly aware of that if one takes somewhat larger numbers, for 
it is then clear that, twist and turn our concepts as we will, without getting 
help from intuition we could never find the sum by means of the 
mere analysis of our concepts.

through this proposition "7 + 5 = I2" and adds a new concept to the former, which 
was not thought in it) in the Prolegomena (4:z69).

Introduction <B> 

Just as little is any principle of pure geometry analytic. That the 
straight line between two points is the shortest is a synthetic proposition. 
For my concept of the straight contains nothing of quantity, but 
only a quality.I8 The concept of the shortest is therefore entirely additional 
to it, and cannot be extracted out of the concept of the straight 
line by any analysis. Help must here be gotten from intuition, by means 
of which alone the synthesis is possible. 

To be sure, a few principles that the geometers presuppose are actually 
analytic and rest on the principle of contradiction; but they alsoa 
only serve, as identical propositions, for the chain of method and not as 
principles,b e.g., a = a, the whole is equal to itself, or (a + b) > a, i.e., the B17 
whole is greater than its part. And yet even these, although they are 

valid in accordance with mere concepts, are admitted in mathematics 
only because they can be exhibited in intuition. 19 What usually makes 
us believe here that the predicate of such apodictic judgments already 
lies in our concept, and that the judgment is therefore analytic, is 
merely the ambiguity of the expression. We should, namely, add a certain 
predicate to a given concept in thought, and this necessity already 
attaches to the concepts. But the question is not what we should think 
in addition to the given concept, but what we actually think in it, 
though only obscurely, and there it is manifest that the predicate certainly 
adheres to those concepts necessarily, though not as thought in 
the concept itself, C but by means of an intuition that must be added to 
the concept. 

2. Natural science (Physica) contains within itself synthetic a priori 
judgments as principles.d I will adduce only a couple of propositions 
as examples, such as the proposition that in all alterations of the 
corporeal world the quantity of matter remains unaltered, or that in all 
communication of motion effect and counter-effect must always be 
equal. In both of these not only the necessity, thus their a priori origin, 
but also that they are synthetic propositions is clear. For in the concept B18 
of matter I do not think persistence, but only its presence in space 
through the filling of space. Thus I actually go beyond the concept of 
matter in order to add something to it a priori that I did not think in it. 
The proposition is thus not analytic, but synthetic, and nevertheless 
thought a priori, and likewise with the other propositions of the pure 
part of natural science.

merely been sought but is nevertheless indispensable because of the nature 
of human reason, synthetic a priori cognitions are supposed to 
be contained, and it is not concerned merely with analyzing concepts 
that we make of things a priori and thereby clarifying them analytically, 
but we want to amplify our cognition a priori; to this end we must make 
use of such principles that add something to the given concepts that was 
not contained in them, and through synthetic a priori judgments go so 
far beyond that experience itself cannot follow us that far, e.g., in the 
proposition "The world must have a first beginning," and others besides, 
and thus metaphysics, at least as far as its end is concerned, consists 
of purely synthetic a priori propositions.20 

VI. 

The general problema of pure reason.21 


B20 
One has already gained a great deal if one can bring a multitude of investigations 
under the formula of a single problem. For one thereby not 
only lightens one's own task, by determining it precisely, but also the 
judgment of anyone else who wants to examine whether we have satisfied 
our plan or not. The real problem of pure reason is now contained 
in the question: How are synthetic judgments a priori possible? 

That metaphysics has until now remained in such a vacillating state 
of uncertainty and contradictions is to be ascribed solely to the cause 
that no one has previously thought of this problem and perhaps even of 
the distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments. On the solution 
of this problem, or on a satisfactory proof that the possibility that 
it demands to have explained does not in fact exist at all, metaphysics 
now stands or falls. David Hume, who among all philosophers came 
closest to this problem, still did not conceive of it anywhere near determinately 
enough and in its universality, but rather stopped with the synthetic 
proposition of the connection of the effect with its cause 
(Principium causalitatis), believing himself to have brought out that such 
an a priori proposition is entirely impossible, and according to his inferences 
everything that we call metaphysics would come down to a 
mere delusion of an alleged insight of reason into that which has in fact 
merely been borrowed from experience and from habit has taken on the 
appearance of necessity; an assertion, destructive of all pure philosophy, 
on which he would never have fallen if he had had our problem in its 
generality before his eyes, since then he would have comprehended that 
according to his argument there could also be no pure mathematics, 
since this certainly contains synthetic a priori propositions, an assertion 

a Aufgabe 


146 


Introduction <B> 
from which his sound understanding would surely have protected 
him.22 
In the solution of the above problem there is at the same time contained 
the possibility of the pure use of reason in the grounding and execution 
of all sciences that contain a theoretical a priori cognition of 
objects, i.e., the answer to the questions: 
How is pure mathematics possible? 
How is pure natural science possible? 
About these sciences, since they are actually given, it can appropriately 
be asked how they are possible; for that they must be possible is 
proved through their actuality. * As far as metaphysics is concerned, 
however, its poor progress up to now, and the fact that of no meta-B 2 I 
physics thus far expounded can it even be said that, as far as its essential 
end is concerned, it even really exists, leaves everyone with ground to 
doubt its possibility. 
But now this kind of cognition is in a certain sense also to be regarded 
as given, and metaphysics is actual, if not as a science yet as a 
natural predisposition (metaphysica naturalis). For human reason, without 
being moved by the mere vanity of knowing it all, inexorably pushes 
on, driven by its own need to such questions that cannot be answered 
by any experiential use of reason and of principlesa borrowed from such 
a use; and thus a certain sort of metaphysics has actually been present 
in all human beings as soon as reason has extended itself to speculation 
in them, and it will also always remain there. And now about this too 
the question is: How is metaphysics as a natural predisposition pos-B22 
sible? i.e., how do the questions that pure reason raises, and which it is 
driven by its own need to answer as well as it can, arise from the nature 
of universal human reason? 
But since unavoidable contradictions have always been found in all 
previous attempts to answer these natural questions, e.g., whether the 
world has a beginning or exists from eternity, etc., one cannot leave it 
up to the mere natural predisposition to metaphysics, i.e., to the pure 
faculty of reason itself, from which, to be sure, some sort of metaphysics 
(whatever it might be) always grows, but it must be possible to bring it 
* Some may still doubt this last point in the case of pure natural science. Yet one B 2 I 
need merely consider the various propositions that come forth at the outset of 
proper (empirical) physics, such as those of the persistence of the same quantity 
of matter, of inertia, of the equality of effect and counter-effect, etc., and 
one will quickly be convinced that they constitute aphysica pura (or rationalis), 
which well deserves to be separately established, as a science of its own, in its 
whole domain, whether narrow or wide.

to certainty regarding either the knowledge or ignorance of objects, i.e., 
to come to a decision either about the objects of its questions or about 
the capacity and incapacity" of reason for judging something about 
them, thus either reliably to extend our pure reason or else to set determinate 
and secure limits for it. This last question, which flows from 
the general problem above, would rightly be this: How is metaphysics 
possible as science? 

The critique of reason thus finally leads necessarily to science; the 
dogmatic use of it without critique, on the contrary, leads to groundless 
B 2 3 assertions, to which one can oppose equally plausible ones, thus to 

skepticism. 


Further, this science cannot be terribly extensive, for it does not deal 
with objectsb of reason, whose multiplicity;c is infinite, but merely with 
itself, with problems that spring entirely from its own womb, and that 
are not set before it by the nature of things that are distinct from it but 
through its own nature; so that, once it has become completely familiar 
with its own capacity"in regard to the objects that may come before it 
in experience, then it must become easy to determine, completely and 
securely, the domain and the bounds of its attempted use beyond all 
bounds of experience. 

B 24 
Thus one can and must regard as undone all attempts made until now 
to bring about a metaphysics dogmatically; for what is analytic in one 
or the other of them, namely the mere analysis of the concepts that inhabit 
our reason a priori, is not the end at all, but only a preparation for 
metaphysics proper, namely extending its a priori cognition synthetically, 
and it is useless for this end, because it merely shows what is contained 
in these concepts, but not how we attain such concepts a priori in 
order thereafter to be able to determine their valid use in regard to the 
objects of all cognition in general. It also requires only a little selfdenial 
in order to give up all these claims, since the contradictions of 
reason, which cannot be denied and which are also unavoidable in dogmatic 
procedure, have long since destroyed the authority of every previous 
metaphysics. More resolution will be necessary in order not to he 
deterred by internal difficulty and external resistance from using another 
approach,' entirely opposed to the previous one, in order to promote 
the productive and fruitful growth of a science that is indispensable 
for human reason, and from which one can chop down every 
stem that has shot up without ever being able to eradicate its root.

The idea and division of a special science 
under the name of a critique of pure reason. 

Now from all of this there results the idea of a special science, which A I I 
can be called the critique of pure reason.b ForC reason is the faculty 
that provides the principlesd of cognition a priori. Hence pure reason is 
that which contains the principlese for cognizing something absolutely 
a priori. An organon of pure reason would be a sum total of all those 
principles!in accordance with which all pure a priori cognitions can be B 25 
acquired and actually brought about. The exhaustive application of 
such an organon would create a system of pure reason. But since that 
requires a lot, and it is still an open question whether such an amplification 
of our knowledge is possible at all and in what cases it would be 
possible, we can regard a science of me mere estimation of pure reason, 
of its sources and boundaries, as the propaedeutic to the system of 
pure reason. Such a thing would not be a doctrine, but must be called 
only a critique of pure reason, and its utility in regard to speculationg 
would really be only negative, serving not for the amplification but only 
for the purification of our reason, and for keeping it free of errors, by 
which a great deal is already won. I call all cognition transcendental that 
is occupied not so much with objects but rather with our mode of cognition 
of objects insofar as this is to be possible a priori.h,23 A system of A I2 
such concepts would be called transcendental philosophy. But this is 
again too much for the beginning. For since such a science would have 
to contain completely both the analytic as well as the synthetic a priori 
cognition, it is, so fari as our aim is concerned, too broad in scope, since 
we need to take the analysis only as far as is indispensably necessary in 
order to provide insight into the principles of a priori synthesis in their 
entire scope, which is our only concern. This investigation, which we B 26\

can properly call not doctrine but only transcendental critique, since it 
does not aim at the amplification of cognitions themselves but only at 
their correction, and is to supply the touchstone of the worth or worthlessness 
of all cognitions a priori, is that with which we are now concerned. 
Such a critique is accordingly a preparation, if possible, for an 
organon, and, if this cannot be accomplished, then at least for a canon, 
in accordance with which the complete system of the philosophy of 
pure reason, whether it is to consist in the amplification or mere limitationa 
of its cognition, can in any case at least some day be exhibited 
both analytically and synthetically. For that this should be possible, in


deed that such a system should not be too great in scope for us to hope 
to be able entirely to complete it, can be assessed in advance from the 
fact that our object is not the nature of things, which is inexhaustible, 
A 13 but the understanding, which judges about the nature of things, and this 
in turn only in regard to its a priori cognition, the supply of which, since 
we do not need to search for it externally, cannot remain hidden from 

us, and in all likelihood is small enough to be completely recorded, its 

worth or worthlessness assessed, and subjected to a correct appraisal. 

B 27 bEven less can one expect here a critique of the books and systems of 
pure reason, but rather that of the pure faculty of reason itself. Only if 
this is one's ground does one have a secure touchstone for appraising 
the philosophical content of old and new works in this specialty; otherwise 
the unqualified historian and judge assesses the groundless assertions 
of others through his own, which are equally groundless. 


'Transcendental philosophy is here the idea of a science,d for which 
the critique of pure reason is to outline the entire plan architectonically, 
i.e., from principles," with a full guarantee for the completeness and certainty 
of all the components that comprise this edifice. It is the system 
of all principles! of pure reason.g That this critique is not itself already 
called transcendental philosophy rests solely on the fact that in order to 
be a complete system it would also have to contain an exhaustive analysis 
of all of human cognition a priori. Now our critique must, to be sure, 
lay before us a complete enumeration of all of the ancestral conceptsh 
that comprise the pure cognition in question. Only it properly refrains 
from the exhaustive analysis of these concepts themselves as well as

from the complete review of all of those derived from them, partly because 
this analysis would not be purposefut,a since it does not contain 
the difficulty encountered in the synthesis on account of which the 
whole critique is actually undertaken, partly because it would be contrary 
to the unity of the plan to take on responsibility for the completeness 
of such an analysis and derivation, from which one could yet 
be relieved given its aim. This completeness of the analysis as well as 
the derivation from the a priori concepts that are to be provided in the 
future will nevertheless be easy to complete as long as they are present 
as exhaustive principlesb of synthesis, and if nothing is lacking in them 
in regard to this essential aim. 


To the critique of pure reason there accordingly belongs everything 
that constitutes transcendental philosophy, and it is the complete idea 
of transcendental philosophy, but is not yet this science itself, since it 
goes only so far in the analysis as is requisite for the complete estimation 
of synthetic a priori cognition. 

The chief target in the division of such a science is that absolutely no 
concept must enter into it that contains anything empirical, or that the 
a priori cognition be entirely pure. Hence, although the supreme principles 
of morality and the fundamental concepts of it are a priori cognitions, 
they still do not belong in transcendental philosophy,' for, while AIS 
they do not, to be sure, take the concepts of pleasure and displeasure, B29 
of desires and inclinations, etc., which are all of empirical origin, as the 
ground of their precepts, they still must necessarily include them in the 
composition of the system of pure morality in the concept of duty, as 
the hindrance that must be overcome or the attraction that ought not 
to be made into a motive. Hence transcendental philosophy is a philosophyt 
of pure, merely speculative reason. For everything practical, insofar 
as it contains incentives,' is related to feelings, which belong 
among empirical sources of cognition. 

Now if one wants to set up the division of this science from the general 
viewpoint of a system in general, then what we will now present 
must contain first a Doctrine of Elements and second a Doctrine of 
Method of pure reason. Each of these main parts will have its subdivision, 
the grounds for which cannot yet be expounded. All that seems

necessary for an introduction or preliminary is that there are two stems 
of human cognition, which may perhaps arise from a common but to us 
unknown root, namely sensibility and understanding, through the first 
of which objects are given to us, but through the second of which they 
are thought. Now if sensibility were to contain a priori representations, 
B 30 which constitute the conditiona under which objects are given to us, it 
will belong to transcendental philosophy. The transcendental doctrine 


A 16 of the senses will have to belong to the first part of the science of elements, 
since the conditions under which alone the objects of human 
cognition are given precede those under which those objects are 
thought.

In whatever way and through whatever means a cognition may relate 
to objects, that through which it relates immediately to them, and at 
which all thought as a means is directed as an end, is intuition.h,2 This, 
however, takes place only insofar as the object is given to us; but this in 
turn, is possible only if it affectsC the mind in a certain way. The capacity 
(receptivity) to acquire representations through the way in which 
we are affected by objects is called sensibility. Objects are therefore 
given to us by means of sensibility, and it alone affords us intuitions; 
but they are thought through the understanding, and from it arise 
concepts. But all thought, whether straightaway (directe) or through a 
detour (indirecte), must ultimately be related to intuitions, thus, in our 
case, to sensibility, since there is no other way in which objects can be 
given to us. 
The effect of an object on the capacity for representation, insofar as 
we are affected by it, is sensation.s" That intuition which is related to the 
B 34 
A 20 
object through sensation is called empirical. The undetermined object 
of an empirical intuition is called appearance.3 
I call that in the appearance which corresponds to sensation its matter, 
but that which allows the manifold of appearance to be intuited as ora 
The "Transcendental Aesthetic" underwent major changes between the two editions of 
the Critique, including but not limited to the separation of the "Metaphysical" and 
"Transcendental" expositions of space and time and the addition of three sections to the 
concluding "General Remarks." We therefore present both versions in their entirety, 
using the marginal pagination and notes to show where specific changes were made. 
The following version from the first edition also includes the notes Kant made in his 
own copy of that edition.

dered in certain relations a I call the fonn of appearance. Since that within 
which the sensations can alone be ordered and placed in a certain form 
cannot itself be in turn sensation, the matter of all appearance is only 
given to us a posteriori, but its form must all lie ready for it in the mind a 
priori, and can therefore be considered separately from all sensation. 

I call all representations pure (in the transcendental sense) in which 
nothing is to be encountered that belongs to sensation. Accordingly the 
pure form of sensible intuitions in general is to be encountered in the 
mind a priori, wherein all of the manifold of appearances is intuited in 
certain relations. This pure form of sensibility itself is also called pure 
B 35 intuition. So if I separate from the representation of a body that which 
the understanding thinks about it, such as substance, force, divisibility, 

A2 I etc., as well as that which belongs to sensation, such as impenetrability, 
hardness, color, etc., something from this empirical intuition is still left 
for me, namely extension and form. These belong to the pure intuition, 
which occurs a priori, even without an actual object of the senses or sensation, 
as a mere form of sensibility in the mind. 

I call a science of all principlesb of a priori sensibility the transcendental 
aesthetic.*A There must therefore be such a science, which 

B 36 constitutes the first part of the transcendental doctrine of elements, in 
contrast to that which contains the principlesc of pure thinking, and is 
named transcendental logic. 

A2 I IB 35 * The Germans are the only ones who now employ the word "aesthetics" to 
designate that which others call the critique of taste. The ground for this is a 
failed hope, held by the excellent analyst Baumgarten, of bringing the critical 
estimation of the beautiful under principles of reason,d and elevating its rules 
to a science. But this effort is futile. For the putative rules or criteria are 
merely empirical as far as their sources are concerned, and can therefore never 
serve as a priori rules according to which our judgment of taste must be directed, 
rather the latter constitutes the genuine touchstone of the correctness 
of the former. For this reason it is advisable again to desist from the use ofthis 
term and to save it for that doctrine which is true science (whereby one would 
come closer to the language and the sense of the ancients, among whom the 
division of cognition into cHu8'Y]TU KaL vO'Y]Ta was very well known).

time, reserving the word Beziehung to denote the relation between objects and the cognitive 
subject (in which sense it is used only four times, to be noted below, in the final 
section of the "Transcendental Aesthetic"). Since "relation" or its plural will thus almost 
always be translating Verhiiltnis or its plural, further notes of the occurrence of this term 
in the "Transcendental Aesthetic" will be omitted.

In the transcendental aesthetic we will therefore first isolate sensibil-A22 
ity by separating off everything that the understanding thinks through 
its concepts, so that nothing but empirical intuition remains. Second, 
we will then detach from the latter everything that belongs to sensation, 
so that nothing remains except pure intuition and the mere form of appearances, 
which is the only thing that sensibility can make available a 
priori. In this investigation it will be found that there are two pure forms 
of sensible intuition as principlesa of a priori cognition, namely space 
and time, with the assessment of which we will now be concerned.

cribed to any thing at all?5 In order to instruct ourselves about this, we 

will consider space first.6 

I) Space is not an empirical concept that has been drawn from outer 
experiences. For in order for certain sensations to be relatedd to something 
outside me (i.e., to something in another place in space from that 
in which I find myself), thus in order for me to represent them as outside 
one another, thus not merely as different but as in different places, 
the representation of space must already be their ground) Thus the 
representation of space cannot be obtained from the relations of outer

appearance through experience, but this outer experience is itself first 
possible only through this representation. a

all outer intuitions.8 One can never represent that there is no space, although 
one can very well think that there are no objects to be encoun


B 39 tered in it.9 It is therefore to be regarded as the condition of the possibility 
of appearances, not as a determination dependent on them, and is 
an a priori representation that necessarily grounds outer appearances.c 

3) The apodictic certainty of all geometrical principles and the possibility 
of their a priori construction are grounded in this a priori necessity. 
For if this representation of space were a concept acquired a posteriori, 
which was drawn out of general outer experience, the first principles of 
mathematical determination would be nothing but perceptions. They 
would therefore have all the contingency of perception, and it would not 
even be necessary that only one straight line lie between two points, but 
experience would merely always teach that. What is borrowed from experience 
always has only comparative universality, namely through induction. 
One would therefore only be able to say that as far as has been 
observed to date, no space has been found that has more than three 
dimensions.d, 10 
4) Space is not a discursive or, as is said, general concept of relations 
1\.25 of things in general, but a pure intuition. For, first, one can only represent 
a single space, and if one speaks of many spaces, one understands 
by that only parts of one and the same unique space. IIAnd these parts 
cannot as it were precede the single all-encompassing space as its components 
(from which its composition would be possible), but rather are 
only thought in it. It is essentially single; the manifold in it, thus also

the general concept of spaces in general, rests merely on limitations. 
From this it follows that in respect to it an a priori intuition (which is 
not empirical) grounds all concepts of them. Thus also all geometrical 
principles, e.g., that in a triangle two sides together are always greater 
than the third, are never derived from general concepts of line and triangle, 
but rather are derived from intuition and indeed derived a priori 
with apodictic certainty. 

5) Space is represented as a given infinite magnitude. A general concept 
of space (which is common to a foot as well as an ell) can determine 
nothing in respect to magnitude. If there were not boundlessness in the 
progress of intuition, no concept of relations could bring with it a principlea 
of their infinity.b,I2 
Conclusions from the above concepts. 

a) Space represents no property at all of any things in themselves nor 
any relation of them to each other, i.e., no determination of them that 
attaches to objects themselves and that would remain even if one were 
to abstract from all subjective conditions of intuition. For neither absolute 
nor relative determinations can be intuited prior to the existence 
of the things to which they pertain, thus be intuited a priori. 13 
b) Space is nothing other than merely the form of all appearances of 
outer sense, i.e., the subjective condition of sensibility, under which 
alone outer intuition is possible for us. Now since the receptivity of the 
subject to be affected by objects necessarily precedes all intuitions of 
these objects, it can be understood how the form of all appearances can 
be given in the mind prior to all actual perceptions, thus a priori, and 
how as a pure intuition, in which all objects must be determined, it can 
contain principlesc of their relations prior to all experience.d 
We can accordingly speak of space, extended beings, and so on, only 
from the human standpoint. If we depart from the subjective condition 
under which alone we can acquire outer intuition, namely that through 
which we may be affected by objects, then the representation of space

their non-existence is not contradictory. Necessity also cannot lie in the empirical intuition. 
For this can, to be sure, carry with it the concept of existence, but not of necessary 
existence. Thus this necessity is not in the object [Object) -objective -at all; 
consequently it is only a necessary condition of the subject for all perceptions of the 
senses." (E XVII, p. 17; 23:22-3)

signifies nothing at all.a This predicate is attributed to things only insofar 
as they appear to us, i.e., are objects of sensibility.b,I4 The constant 
form of this receptivity, which we call sensibility, is a necessary condition 
of all the relations within which objects can be intuited as outside 
us, and, if one abstracts from these objects, it is a pure intuition, which 
bears the name of space. Since we cannot make the special conditions of 
sensibility into conditions of the possibility of things, but only of their 
appearances, we can well say that space comprehends all things that 
may appear to us externally, but not all things in themselves, whether 
they be intuited or not, ord by whatever subject they may be intuited. 
For we cannot judge at all whether the intuitions of other thinking beings 
are bound to the same conditions that limit our intuition and that 
are universally valid for us. If we add the limitatione of a judgment to the 
concept of the subject, then the judgment is unconditionally valid. The 
proposition "All things are next to one another in space"! is valid only 
under the limitation that these things be taken as objects of our sensible 
intuition. Ifhere I add the condition to the concept and say: "All things, 
as outer intuitions, are next to one another in space," then this rule is 


B44 valid universally and without limitation. Our expositions accordingly 

Az8 teach the reality (i.e., objective validity) of space in regard to everything 
that can come before us externally as an object, but at the same timeg the 
ideality of space in regard to things when they are considered in themselves 
through reason, i.e., without taking account of the constitution of 
our sensibility. We therefore assert the empirical reality of space (with 
respect to all possible outer experience), though to be sure at the same 
time its transcendental ideality, i.e., that it is nothing as soon as we 
leave out the condition of the possibility of all experience, and take it as 
something that grounds the things in themselves. 

a Inserted in Kant's copy: "Perhaps all created beings are bound to it, that we do not 
know. This much one can know, that it is a merely sensible form. The most important 
thing is that it yields a determinate concept a priori, and through inner intuition we 
would not have sensations, thus no empirical representations and no science of objects

Section I. On Space <A> 
Besides space, however, there is no other subjective representation 
relateda to something external that could be called a priori objective. 
bHence this subjective condition of all outer appearances cannot be 
compared with any other. The pleasant taste of a wine does not belong 
to the objective determinations of the wine, thus of an object" even considered 
as an appearance, but rather to the particular constitution of 
sense in the subject that enjoys it. Colors are not objective qualities of 
the bodies to the intuition of which they are attached, but are also only 
modifications of the sense of sight, which is affected by light in a certain 
way. Space, on the contrary, as a condition of outer objects/ necessarily 
belongs to their appearance or intuition. Taste and colors are by 
no means necessary conditions under which alone the objects can be A29 
objectse of the senses for us. They are only combined with the appearance 
as contingently added effects of the particular organization. Hence 
they are not a priori representations, but are grounded on sensation, and 
pleasant taste is even grounded on feeling (of pleasure and displeasure) 
as an effect of the sensation. And no one can have a priori the representation 
either of a color or of any taste: but space concerns only the pure 
form of intuition, thus it includes no sensation (nothing empirical) in itself, 
and all kinds and determinations of space can and even must be 
able to be represented a priori if concepts of shapes as well as relations 
are to arise. Through space alone is it possible for things to be outer objects 
for us! 
The aim of this remark is only to prevent one from thinking of illusB45 
trating the asserted ideality of space with completely inadequate examples, 
since things like colors, taste, etc., are correctly considered not as 
qualities of things but as mere alterations of our subject, which can even 
be different in different people. For in this case that which is originally 
itself only appearance, e.g., a rose, counts in an empirical sense as a 
thing in itself, which yet can appear different to every eye in regard to A30 
color. The transcendental concept of appearances in space, on the contrary, 
is a critical reminder that absolutely nothing that is intuited in 
space is a thing in itself, and that space is not a form that is proper to

Second Section 
On time.IS 


I Y Time is not an empirical concept that is somehow drawn from an experience. 
For simultaneity or succession would not themselves come 
into perception if the representation of time did not ground them a priori. 
Only under its presupposition can one represent that several things 
exist at one and the same time (simultaneously) or in different times 
(successively). 

A 3 I 2) Time is a necessary representation that grounds all intuitions. In 
regard to appearances in general one cannot remove time, though one 
can very well take the appearances away from time. Time is therefore 
given apriori. In it alone is all actuality of appearances possible. The latter 
could all disappear, but time itself, as the universal condition of their 
possibility, cannot be removed. 


B47 3) This a priori necessity also grounds the possibility of apodictic 
principles of the relations of time, or axioms of time in general. It has 
only one dimension: different times are not simultaneous, but successive 
(just as different spaces are not successive, but simultaneous). 
These principles could not be drawn from experience, for this would 
yield neither strict universality nor apodictic certainty. We would only 
be able to say: This is what common perception teaches, but not: This 
is how matters must stand. These principles are valid as rules under 
which experiences are possible at all, and instruct us prior to them, not 
through it.b 


4) Time is no discursive or, as one calls it, general concept, but a pure 
A 3 2 form of sensible intuition. Different times are only parts of one and the 
same time.I6 That representation, however, which can only be given 
through a single object, is an intuition. Further, the proposition that 
different times cannot be simultaneous cannot be derived from a gen-

a Then" I" is actually printed at above the center of the first line of this paragraph rather 
than at its beginning. 

b The text reads "belehren uns vor derselben, und llicht durch dieselbe." Earlier editors suggested 
emending the last word to "dieselben" but if the sentence is interpreted to mean 
"instructs us prior to experiences, not through common perception," it can be read 
without emendation.

eral concept. The proposition is synthetic, and cannot arise from concepts 
alone. It is therefore immediately contained in the intuition and 
representation of time. 
5) The infinitude of time signifies nothing more than that every determinate 
magnitude of time is only possible through limitations of a B48 
single time grounding it. The original representation, time, must therefore 
be given as unlimited. But where the parts themselves and every 
magnitude of an object can be determinately represented only through 
limitation, there the entire representation cannot be given through 
concepts (for then the partial representations precede) but their immediate 
intuition must be the ground. '7 
Conclusions from these concepts. B49 
a) Time is not something that would subsist for itself or attach to things 
as an objective determination, and thus remain if one abstracted from 
all subjective conditions of the intuition of them; for in the first case it 
would be something that was actual yet without an actual object. As far 
as the second case is concerned, however, time could not precede the A 33 
objects as a determination or order attaching to the things themselves 
as their condition and be cognized and intuited a priori through synthetic 
propositions. But the latter, on the contrary, can very well occur 
if time is nothing other than the subjective condition under which all 
intuitions can take place in us. For then this form of inner intuition can 
be represented prior to the objects, thus a priori. IS 
b) Time is nothing other than the form of inner sense, i.e., of the intuition 
of our self and our inner state.'9 For time cannot be a determination 
of outer appearances; it belongs neither to a shape or a position, B 50 
etc., but on the contrary determines the relation of representations in 
our inner state. And just because this inner intuition yields no shape we 
also attempt to remedy this lack through analogies, and represent the 
temporal sequence through a line progressing to infinity, in which the 
manifold constitutes a series that is of only one dimension, and infer 
from the properties of this line to all the properties of time, with the 
sole difference that the parts of the former are simultaneous but those 
of the latter always exist successively. From this it is also apparent that 
the representation of time is itself an intuition, since all its relations can 
be expressed in an outer intuition. 
c) Time is the a priori formal condition of all appearances in general. A34 
Space, as the pure form of all outer intuitions, is limited as an a priori 
condition merely to outer intuitions. But since, on the contrary, all representations, 
whether or not they have outer things as their object, nevertheless 
as determinations of the mind themselves belong to the inner 
state, while this inner state belongs under the formal condition of inner 


163 


Doctrine of Elements. Part 1. The Transcendental Aesthetic <A> 

intuition, and thus of time, so time is an a priori condition of all appearance 
in general, and indeed the immediate condition of the inner 
intuition (of our souls), and thereby also the mediate condition of outer 
appearances. If I can say a priori: all outer appearances are in space and 
determined a priori according to the relations of space, so from the 
principlea of inner sense I can say entirely generally: all appearances in 
general, i.e., all objects of the senses, are in time, and necessarily stand 
in relations of time. 

If we abstract from our way of internally intuiting ourselves and by 
means of this intuition also dealing with all outer intuitions in the 
power of representation, and thus take objects as they may be in themselves, 
then time is nothing. It is only of objective validity in regard to 
appearances, because these are already things that we take as objects of 

A 35 our senses; but it is no longer objective if one abstracts from the sensibility 
of our intuition, thus from that kind of representation that is peculiar 
to us, and speaks of things in general. Time is therefore merely 
a subjective condition of our (human) intuition (which is always sensible, 
i.e., insofar as we are affected by objects), and in itself, outside the 
subject, is nothing. Nonetheless it is necessarily objective in regard to 
all appearances, thus also in regard to all things that can come before us 
in experience. We cannot say all things are in time, because with the 

B 52 concept of things in general abstraction is made from every kind of intuition 
of them, but this is the real condition under which time belongs 
to the representation of objects. Now if the condition is added to the 
concept, and the principle says that all things as appearances (objects of 
sensible intuition) are in time, then the principle has its sound objective 
correctness and a priori universality. 
Our assertions accordingly teach the empirical reality of time, i.e., 
objective validity in regard to all objects that may ever be given to our 
senses. And since our intuition is always sensible, no object can ever be 
given to us in experience that would not belong under the condition of 
time. But, on the contrary, we dispute all claim of time to absolute reality, 
namely where it would attach to things absolutely as a condition 

A36 or property even without regard to the form of our sensible intuition. 
Such properties, which pertain to things in themselves, can never be 
given to us through the senses. In this therefore consists the transcendental 
ideality of time, according to which it is nothing at all if one abstracts 
from the subjective conditions of sensible intuition, and cannot 
be counted as either subsisting or inhering in the objects in themselves 
(without their relation to our intuition). Yet this ideality is to be com-

B 53 pared with the subreptions of sensation just as little as that of space is, 
because in that case one presupposes that the appearance itself, in which 

« Princip 

B 5I 
164 



Section II. On Time <A> 

these predicates inhere, has objective reality, which is here entirely absent 
except insofar as it is merely empirical, i.e., the object itself is regarded 
merely as appearance: concerning which the above remark in 
the previous section is to be consulted.a,b 

Elucidation. 

Against this theory, which concedes empirical reality to time but disputes 
its absolute and transcendental reality, insightful men have so 
unanimously proposed one objection that I conclude that it must naturally 
occur to every reader who is not accustomed to these considerations.
20 It goes thus: Alterations are real (this is proved by the change of A 37 
our own representations, even if one would deny all outer appearances 
together with their alterations). Now alterations are possible only in 
time, therefore time is something real. There is no difficulty in answering. 
I admit the entire argument. Time is certainly something real/ 
namely the real form of inner intuition. It therefore has subjective reality 
in regard to inner experience, i.e., I really have the representation of 
time and of my determinations in it. It is therefore to be regarded re-B 54 
ally not as object! but as the way of representing myself as object! But 
if I or another being could intuit myself without this condition of sensibility, 
then these very determinations, which we now represent to ourselves 
as alterations, would yield us a cognition in which the representation 
of time and thus also of alteration would not occur at all. Its 
empirical reality therefore remains as a condition of all our experiences. 
Only absolute reality cannot be granted to it according to what has been 
adduced above. It is nothing except the form of our inner intuition. * If 

* I can, to be sure, say: my representations succeed one another; but that only 
means that we are conscious of them as in a temporal sequence, i.e., according 
to the form of inner sense. Time is not on that account something in itself, 
nor any determination objectively adhering to things. 
a 

This refers to A28-30/B44-5 in § 3. 

b Inserted in Kant's copy, before the next section: "Space and time are not merely logical 
forms of our sensibility, i.e., they do not consist in the fact that we represent actual relations 
to ourselves confusedly; for then how could we derive from them a priori synthetic 
and true propositions? We do not intuit space, but in a confused manner; rather 
it is the form of our intuition. Sensibility is not confusion of representations, but the 
subjective condition of consciousness." (E XXVIII, p. 20; 23:23) 

C Kant's copy adds: "So is space. This proves that here a reality (consequently also individual 
intuition) is given, which yet always grounds the reality as a thing. Space and time 
do not belong to the reality of things, but only to our representations." (E XXIX, p. 20; 
23:24)

one removes the special condition of our sensibility from it, then the 
concept of time also disappears, and it does not adhere to the objects 
A38 themselves, rather merely to the subject that intuits them.2I 
The cause, however, on account of which this objection is so unanimously 
made, and indeed by those who nevertheless know of nothing 

B55 convincing to object against the doctrine of the ideality of space,"2 is 
this. They did not expect to be able to demonstrate the absolute reality 
of space apodictically, since they were confronted by idealism, according 
to which the reality of outer objects is not capable of any strict proof; 
on the contrary, the reality of the object of our inner sense (of myself 
and my state) is immediately clear through consciousness. The former 
could have been a mere illusion, but the latter, according to their opinion, 
is undeniably something real. But they did not consider that both, 
without their reality as representations being disputed, nevertheless belong 
only to appearance, which always has two sides, one where the object" 
is considered in itself (without regard to the way in which it is to be 
intuited, the constitution of which however must for that very reason always 
remain problematic), the other where the form of the intuition of 
this object is considered, which must not be sought in the object in itself 
but in the subject to which it appears, but which nevertheless really 
and necessarily pertains to the representation of this object. 


Time and space are accordingly two sources of cognition, from which 
A 39 different synthetic cognitions can be drawn a priori, of which especially 
pure mathematics in regard to the cognitions of space and its relations 

B 56 provides a splendid example.23 Both taken together are, namely, the 
pure forms of all sensible intuition, and thereby make possible synthetic 
a priori propositions. But these a priori sources of cognition determine 
their own boundaries by that very fact (that they are merely conditions 
of sensibility), namely that they apply to objects only so far as they are 
considered as appearances, but do not present things in themselves. 
Those alone are the field of their validity, beyond which no further objective 
use of them takes place. This reality of space and time, further, 
leaves the certainty of experiential cognition untouched: for we are just 
as certain of that whether these forms necessarily adhere to the things /
in themselves or only to our intuition of these things. Those, however, 
who assert the absolute reality of space and time, whether they assume 
it to be subsisting or only inhering, must themselves come into conflict 
with the principlesb of experience. For if they decide in favor of the first 
(which is generally the position of the mathematical investigators of nature),
z4 then they must assume two eternal and infinite self-subsisting 
non-entities (space and time), which exist (yet without there being any

or successive to or successive to 
Section II. On Time <A> 

thing real) only in order to comprehend everything real within themselves. 
If they adopt the second position (as do some metaphysicians of A 40 
nature), and hold space and time to be relations of appearances (next to 

one another) that are abstracted from experience 
though confusedly represented in this abstraction, then they must dis-B 57 
pute the validity or at least the apodictic certainty of a priori mathematical 
doctrines in regard to real things (e.g., in space), since this certainty 
does not occur a posteriori, and on this view the a priori concepts of space 
and time are only creatures of the imagination, the origin of which must 
really be sought in experience, out of whose abstracted relations imagination 
has made something that, to be sure, contains what is general in 
them, but that cannot occur without the restrictions that nature has attached 
to them.2; The first succeed in opening the field of appearances 
for mathematical assertions; however, they themselves become very 
confused through precisely these conditions if the understanding would 
go beyond this field. The second succeed, to be sure, with respect to the 
latter, in that the representations of space and time do not stand in their 
way if they would judge of objects not as appearances but merely in relation 
to the understanding; but they can neither offer any ground for 
the possibility of a priori mathematical cognitions (since they lack a true 
and objectively valid a priori intuition), nor can they bring the propositions 
of experience into necessary accord with those assertions. On our A4I 
theory of the true constitution of these two original forms of sensibility B 58 
both difficulties are remedied.a 

Finally, that the transcendental aesthetic cannot contain more than 
these two elements, namely space and time, is clear from the fact that 
all other concepts belonging to sensibility, even that of motion, which 
unites both elements, presuppose something empiricatz6 For this presupposes 
the perception of something movable. In space considered in 
itself there is nothing movable; hence the movable must be something 
that is found in space only through experience, thus an empirical 
datum. In the same way the transcendental aesthetic cannot count the 
concept of alteration among its a priori data; for time itself does not 
alter, but only something that is within time. For this there is required 
the perception of some existence and the succession of its determinations, 
thus experience.b 

a Inserted in Kant's copy: "Leibniz's system of space and time was to transform both into 
intellectual but confused concepts. But from this the possibility of a priori cognition 
cannot be understood, for in that case both must precede." (E XXX, p. 20; 23:24) 

b Inserted in Kant's copy: "Conclusion: That space and time of course have objective reality,

hence solely as appearances." (E XXXI, p. 2I; 23:24)

B 59 General remarks 
on the transcendental aesthetic. 

A42 
It will first be necessary to explain as distinctly as possible our opinion 
in regard to the fundamental constitution of sensible cognition in 
general, in order to preclude all misinterpretation of it. 

We have therefore wanted to say that all our intuition is nothing but 
the representation of appearance; that the things that we intuit are not 
in themselves what we intuit them to be, nor are their relations so constituted 
in themselves as they appear to us; and that if we remove our 
own subject or even only the subjective constitution of the senses in 
general, then all the constitution, all relations of objectsa in space and 
time, indeed space and time themselves would disappear, and as appearances 
they cannot exist in themselves, but only in us. What may be 
the case with objects in themselves and abstracted from all this receptivity 
of our sensibility remains entirely unknown to us. We are acquainted 
with nothing except our way of perceiving them, which is 
peculiar to us, and which therefore does not necessarily pertain to every 
being, though to be sure it pertains to every human being. We are con-

B 60 cerned solely with this. Space and time are its pure forms, sensation in 
general its matter. We can cognize only the former a priori, i.e., prior to 
all actual perception, and they are therefore called pure intuition; the 
latter, however, is that in our cognition that is responsible for it being 
called a posteriori cognition, i.e., empirical intuition. The former adheres 
to our sensibility absolutely necessarily, whatever sort of sensations 
we may have; the latter can be very different. Even if we could


A43 

bring this intuition of ours to the highest degree of distinctness we 
would not thereby come any closer to the constitution of objects in 
themselves. For in any case we would still completely cognize only our 
own way of intuiting, i.e., our sensibility, and this always only under the 
conditions originally depending on the subject, space and time; what 
the objects may be in themselves would still never be known through 
the most enlightened cognition of their appearance, which is alone 
given to us. 

That our entire sensibility is nothing but the confused representation 
of things, which contains solely that which pertains to them in themselves 
but only under a heap of marks and partial representations that 
we can never consciously separate from one another, is therefore a falsification 
of the concept of sensibility and of appearance that renders 
the entire theory of them useless and empty. The difference between an 
B6I indistinct and a distinct representation is merely logical, and does not 
concern the content. Without doubt the concept of right that is used 

a Objecte 


168 



Section II. On Time <A> 
by the healthy understanding contains the very same things that the 
most subtle speculation can evolve out of it, only in common and practical 
use one is not conscious of these manifold representations in these 
thoughts. Thus one cannot say that the common concept is sensible and 
contains a mere appearance, for right cannot appear at all; rather its A44 
concept lies in the understanding and represents a constitution (the 
moral constitution) of actions that pertains to them in themselves. The 
representation of a body in intuition, on the contrary, contains nothing 
at all that could pertain to an object in itself, but merely the appearance 
of something and the way in which we are affected by it; and this receptivity 
of our cognitive capacity is called sensibility and remains 
worlds apart from the cognition of the object in itself even if one might 
see through to the very bottom of it (the appearance). 
The Leibnizian-Wolffian philosophy has therefore directed all investigations 
of the nature and origin of our cognitions to an entirely unjust 
point of view in considering the distinction between sensibility and the 
intellectual as merely logical, since it is obviously transcendental, and 
does not concern merely the form of distinctness or indistinctness, but its B62 
origin and content, so that through sensibility we do not cognize the 
constitution of things in themselves merely indistinctly, but rather not at 
all, and, as soon as we take away our subjective constitution, the represented 
object" with the properties that sensible intuition attributes to it 
is nowhere to be encountered, nor can it be encountered, for it is just this 
subjective constitution that determines its form as appearance.27 
We ordinarily distinguish quite well between that which is essentially A45 
attached to the intuition of appearances, and is valid for every human 
sense in general, and that which pertains to them only contingently because 
it is not valid for the relationb to sensibility in general but only for 
a particular situation or organization of this or that sense. And thus one 
calls the first cognition one that represents the object in itself, but the 
second one only its appearance. This distinction, however, is only empirical. 
If one stands by it (as commonly happens) and does not regard 
that empirical intuition as in turn mere appearance (as ought to happen), 
so that there is nothing to be encountered in it that pertains to any 
thing in itself, then our transcendental distinction is lost, and we believe 
ourselves to cognize things in themselves, although we have nothing to 
do with anything except appearances anywhere (in the world of sense), B63 
even in the deepest research into its objects. Thus, we would certainly

call a rainbow a mere appearance in a sun-shower, but would call this 
rain the thing in itself, and this is correct, as long as we understand the 
latter concept in a merely physical sense, as that which in universal experience 
and all different positions relative to the senses is always determined 
thus and not otherwise in intuition. But if we consider this 
A46 empirical object in general and, without turning to its agreement with 
every human sense, ask whether it (not the raindrops, since these, as appearances, 
are already empirical objects)" represents an object in itself, 
then the question of the relation of the representation to the object is 
transcendental, and not only these drops are mere appearances, but 
even their round form, indeed even the space through which they fall 
are nothing in themselves, but only mere modifications or foundationsb 
of our sensible intuition; the transcendental object,c however, remains 
unknown to us. 
The second important concern of our transcendental aesthetic is that 
it not merely earn some favor as a plausible hypothesis, but that it be as 
certain and indubitable as can ever be demanded of a theory that is to 
serve as an organon. In order to make this certainty fully convincing we 
will choose a case in which its validity can become obvious. 
Thus, if it were to be supposed that space and time are in themselves 
objective and conditions of the possibility of things in themselves, then 
it would be shown, first, that there is a large number of a priori apodictic 
and synthetic propositions about both, but especially about space, 
which we will therefore here investigate as our primary example. Since 
B64 
the propositions of geometry are cognized synthetically a priori and 
with apodictic certainty, I ask: Whence do you take such propositions, 

A47 

and on what does our understanding rely in attaining to such absolutely 
necessary and universally valid truths?d There is no other way than 
through concepts or through intuitions, both of which, however, are 
given, as such, either a priori or a posteriori. The latter, namely empirical 
concepts, together with that on which they are grounded, empirical 
intuition, cannot yield any synthetic proposition except one that is also 
merely empirical, i.e., a proposition of experience; thus it can never 
contain necessity and absolute universality of the sort that is nevertheless 
characteristic of all propositions of geometry. Concerning the first 
and only means for attaining to such cognitions, however, namely 
through mere concepts or a priori intuitions, it is clear that from mere 
concepts no synthetic cognition but only merely analytic cognition can 
B6S be attained. Take the proposition that with two straight lines no space

Section II. On Time <A> 


at all can be enclosed, thus no figure is possible, and try to derive it from 
the concept of straight lines and the number two; or take the proposition 
that a figure is possible with three straight lines, and in the same 
way try to derive it from these concepts. All of your effort is in vain, and 
you see yourself forced to take refuge in intuition, as indeed geometry 
always does. You thus give yourself an object in intuition; but what kind A48 
is this, is it a pure a priori intuition or an empirical one? If it were the 
latter, then no universally valid, let alone apodictic proposition could 
ever come from it: for experience can never provide anything of this 
sort. You must therefore give your object a priori in intuition, and 
ground your synthetic proposition on this. If there did not lie in you a 
faculty for intuiting a priori; if this subjective condition regarding form 
were not at the same time the universal a priori condition under which 
alone the object" of this (outer) intuition is itself possible; if the object 
(the triangle) were something in itself without relation to your subject: 
then how could you say that what necessarily lies in your subjective conditions 
for constructing a triangle must also necessarily pertain to the 
triangle in itself?b for you could not add to your concept (of three lines) 
something new (the figure) that must thereby necessarily be encounB66 
tered in the object, since this is given prior to your cognition and not 
through it. If, therefore, space (and time as well) were not a mere form 
of your intuition that contains a priori conditions under which alone 
things could be outer objects for you, which are nothing in themselves 
without these subjective conditions, then you could make out absolutely 
nothing synthetic and a priori about outer objects.c,28 It is therefore indubitably 
certain, and not merely possible or even probable, that space 
and time, as the necessary conditions of all (outer and inner) experience, A49 
are merely subjective conditions of all our intuition, in relationd to 
which therefore all objects are mere appearances and not things given 
for themselves in this way; about these appearances, further, much may 
be said a priori that concerns their form, but nothing whatsoever about 
the things in themselves that may ground them.'

In whatever way and through whatever means a cognition may relate to 
objects, that through which it relates immediately to them, and at which 
all thought as a means is directed as an end, is intuition. This, however, 
takes place only insofar as the object is given to us; but this in turn, <at 
least for us humans,> is possible only if it affects the mind in a certain 
way. The capacity (receptivity) to acquire representations through the 
way in which we are affected by objects is called sensibility. Objects are 
therefore given to us by means of sensibility, and it alone affords us intuitions; 
but they are thought through the understanding, and from it 
arise concepts. But all thought, whether straightaway (directe) or 
through a detour (indirecte), must, <by means of certain marks,> ultimately 
be related to intuitions, thus, in our case, to sensibility, since 
there is no other way in which objects can be given to us. 

The effect of an object on the capacity for representation, insofar as 
we are affected by it, is sensation. That intuition which is related to the 
object through sensation is called empirical. The undetermined object 
of an empirical intuition is called appearance. 

I call that in the appearance which corresponds to sensation its matter, 
but that which allows the manifold of appearance to be orderedc in

a We here present the revised version of the "Transcendental Aesthetic" that Kant prepared 
for the second edition of the Critique. Since in addition to the major changes that 
he made, all of which will be noted, Kant also made numerous minor changes that it 
would be cumbersome to note individually, we will enclose all the changes Kant made 

in Bwithin angled brackets « ..n. »,whether or not they are otherwise noted. Editorial 

notes on passages unchanged from A will not be repeated. 

b In the second edition, Kant divided the "Transcendental Doctrine of Elements" from 
the beginning of the "Transcendental Aesthetic" through the end of the "Transcendental 
Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding" into twenty-seven numbered 
sections. In the case of some sections, new titles were also added for material 
otherwise taken over without other change from the first edition. 

, In the first edition this reads "intuited as ordered in certain relations ..." 

172 



The Transcendental Aesthetic <B> 

certain relationsa I call the form of appearance. Since that within which 
the sensations can alone be ordered and placed in a certain form cannot 
itself be in turn sensation, the matter of all appearance is only given to 
us a posteriori, but its form must all lie ready for it in the mind a priori, 
and can therefore be considered separately from all sensation. 

I call all representations pure (in the transcendental sense) in which 
nothing is to be encountered that belongs to sensation. Accordingly the 
pure form of sensible intuitions in general is to be encountered in the 
mind a priori, wherein all of the manifold of appearances is intuited in 
certain relations. This pure form of sensibility itself is also called pure 
intuition. So if I separate from the representation of a body that which B 35 
the understanding thinks about it, such as substance, force, divisibility, 
etc., as well as that which belongs to sensation, such as impenetrability, 
hardness, color, etc., something from this empirical intuition is still left A21 
for me, namely extension and form. These belong to the pure intuition, 
which occurs a priori, even without an actual object of the senses or sensation, 
as a mere form of sensibility in the mind. 

I call a science of all principlesb of a priori sensibility the transcendental 
aesthetic. * There must therefore be such a science, which constitutes 
the first part of the transcendental doctrine of elements, in B 36 
opposition to that which contains the principlesc of pure thinking, and 
which is named transcendental logic. 

* The Germans are the only ones who now employ the word "aesthetics" to des-A 2 I /B 35 
ignate that which others call the critique of taste. The ground for this is a failed 
hope, held by the excellent analyst Baumgarten, of bringing the critical estimation 
of the beautiful under principles of reason,d and elevating its rules to a science. 
But this effort is futile. For the putative rules or criteria are merely empirical 
as far as their <most prominent> sources are concerned, and can therefore 
never serve as <determinate> a priori rules according to which our judgment of 
taste must be directed; rather the latter constitutes the genuine touchstone of the 
correctness of the former. For this reason it is advisable <either> again to desist B 36 
from the use of this term and preserve it for that docu'ine which is true science 
(whereby one would come closer to the language and the sense of the ancients, 
among whom the division of cognition into CHe1JTG¥ Kat V01JTG¥ was very well 
known), <or else to share the term with speculative philosophy and take aesthetics 
partly in a transcendental meaning, partly in a psychological meaning>. 
a As already noted at p. 156, note a, with the exception of four cases in its final section, 
throughout the "Transcendental Aesthetic" Kant characteristically uses the term 
Verbaltnis, connoting a relation among objects, rather than Beziebung, connoting a relation 
between subject and object; thus, unless otherwise noted, "relation" or its plural 
translates Verbaltnis or its derivatives.

A22 In the transcendental aesthetic we will therefore first isolate sensibility 
by separating off everything that the understanding thinks 
through its concepts, so that nothing but empirical intuition remains. 
Second, we will then detach from the latter everything that belongs to 
sensation, so that nothing remains except pure intuition and the mere 
form of appearances, which is the only thing that sensibility can make 
available a priori. In this investigation it will be found that there are two 
pure forms of sensible intuition as principles a of a priori cognition, 
namely space and time, with the assessment of which we will now be 
concerned. 

The Transcendental Aesthetic 
First Section 
On space. 


<§ 2 

Metaphysical exposition of this concept.> 

By means of outer sense (a property of our mind) we represent to 
ourselves objects as outside us, and all as in space. In space their shape, 
magnitude, and relation to one another is determined, or determinable. 
Inner sense, by means of which the mind intuits itself, or its inner state, 
gives, to be sure, no intuition of the soul itself, as an object;h yet it is 
still a determinate form, under which the intuition of its inner state is 
alone possible, so that everything that belongs to the inner determinations 
is represented in relations of time. Time can no more be intuited 
externally than space can be intuited as something in us. Now what are 
space and time? Are they actual entities?C Are they only determinations 
or relations of things, yet ones that would pertain to them even if they 
were not intuited, or are they relations that only attach to the form of 

B 38 intuition alone, and thus to the subjective constitution of our mind, 
without which these predicates could not be ascribed to any thing at all? 
In order to instruct ourselves about this, we will <expound the concept 
of space> first.d <l understand by exposition (expositio) the distinct 
(even if not complete) representation of that which belongs to a concept; 
but the exposition is metaphysical when it contains that which 
exhibits the concept as given a priori.

Section 1. On Space <B> 
experiences. For in order for certain sensations to be relateda to something 
outside me (i.e., to something in another place in space from that 
in which I find myself), thus in order for me to represent them as outside 
<and next to> one another, thus not merely as different but as in 
different places, the representation of space must already be their 
ground. Thus the representation of space cannot be obtained from the 
relations of outer appearance through experience, but this outer experience 
is itself first possible only through this representation. 
2) Space is a necessary representation, a priori, that is the ground of A24 
all outer intuitions. One can never represent that there is no space, 
though one can very well think that there are no objects to be encountered 
in it. It is therefore to be regarded as the condition of the possi-B 39 
bility of appearances, not as a determination dependent on them, and is 
an a priori representation that necessarily grounds outer appearances.b 
<3» Space is not a discursive or, as is said, general concept of relations 
of things in general, but a pure intuition. For, first, one can only A25 
represent a single space, and if one speaks of many spaces, one understands 
by that only parts of one and the same unique space. And these 
parts cannot as it were precede the single all-encompassing space as its 
components (from which its composition would be possible), but rather 
are only thought in it. It is essentially single; the manifold in it, thus 
also the general concept of spaces in general, rests merely on limitations. 
From this it follows that in respect to it an a priori intuition 
(which is not empirical) grounds all concepts of it.C Thus also all geometrical 
principles, e.g., that in a triangle two sides together are always 
greater than the third, are never derived from general concepts of line 
and triangle, but rather are derived from intuition and indeed derived a 
priori with apodictic certainty. 
<d4) Space is represented as an infinite given magnitude. Now one 
must, to be sure, think of every concept as a representation that is conB40 
tained in an infinite set of different possible representations (as their 
common mark), which thus contains these under itself; but no concept, 
as such, can be thought as if it contained an infinite set of representations 
within itself. Nevertheless space is so thought (for all the 
parts of space, even to infinity, are simultaneous). Therefore the original 
representation of space is an a priori intuition, not a concept.>

of them, thus only as the form of outer sense in general. 

Thus our explanation alone makes the possibility of geometry as a 
synthetic a priori cognition comprehensible. Any kind of explanation 
that does not accomplish this, even if it appears to have some similarity 
with it, can most surely be distinguished from it by means of this 

Conclusions from the above concepts. 

a) Space represents no property at all of any things in themselves nor 
any relation of them to each other, i.e., no determination of them that 
attaches to objects themselves and that would remain even if one were 
to abstract from all subjective conditions of intuition. For neither absolute 
nor relative determinations can be intuited prior to the existence 
of the things to which they pertain, thus be intuited a priori. 
841 
Doctrine of Elements. Part 1. The Transcendental Aesthetic <B> 

<§ 3 

Transcendental exposition of the concept of space. 

I understand by a transcendental exposition the explanation of a 
concept as a principlea from which insight into the possibility of other 
synthetic a priori cognitions can be gained. For this aim it is required r) 
that such cognitions actually flow from the given concept, and 2) that 
these cognitions are only possible under the presupposition of a given 
way of explaining this concept. 

Geometry is a science that determines the properties of space synthetically 
and yet a priori. vv'hat then must the representation of space 
be for such a cognition of it to be possible? It must originally be intuition; 
for from a mere concept no propositions can be drawn that go beyond 
the concept, which, however, happens in geometry (Introduction 
V). But this intuition must be encountered in us a priori, i.e., prior to all 
perception of an object, thus it must be pure, not empirical intuition. 
For geometrical propositions are all apodictic, i.e., combined with consciousness 
of their necessity, e.g., space has only three dimensions; but 
such propositions cannot be empirical or judgments of experience, nor 
inferred from them (Introduction II). 

Now how can an outer intuition inhabit the mind that precedes the 
objectsb themselves, and in which the concept of the latter can be determined 
a priori? Obviously not otherwise than insofar as it has its seat 
merely in the subject, as its formal constitution for being affected by ob

Section 1. On Space <B> 

b) Space is nothing other than merely the form of all appearances of 
outer sense, i.e., the subjective condition of sensibility, under which 
alone outer intuition is possible for us. Now since the receptivity of the 
subject to be affected by objects necessarily precedes all intuitions of 
these objects, it can be understood how the form of all appearances can 
be given in the mind prior to all actual perceptions, thus a priori, and 
how as a pure intuition, in which all objects must be determined, it can 
contain principlesa of their relations prior to all experience. 
We can accordingly speak of space, extended beings, and so on, only 
from the human standpoint. If we depart from the subjective condition 
under which alone we can acquire outer intuition, namely that through 
which we may be affected by objects, then the representation of space 
signifies nothing at all. This predicate is attributed to things only insofar 
as they appear to us, i.e., are objects of sensibility. The constant form 
of this receptivity, which we call sensibility, is a necessary condition of 
all the relations within which objects can be intuited as outside us, and, 
if one abstracts from these objects, it is a pure intuition, which bears the 
name of space. Since we cannot make the special conditions of sensibility 
into conditions of the possibility of things, but only of their appearances, 
we can well say that space comprehends all things that may 
appear to us externally, but not all things in themselves, whether they 
be intuited or not, or by whatever subject they may be intuited. For we 
cannot judge at all whether the intuitions of other thinking beings are 
bound to the same conditions that limit our intuition and that are universally 
valid for us. If we add the limitation of a judgment to the concept 
of the subject, then the judgment is unconditionally valid. The 
proposition: "All things are next to one another in space," is valid under 
the limitation that these things be taken as objects of our sensible intuition. 
If here I add the condition to the concept and say "All things, as 
outer intuitions, are next to one another in space," then this rule is valid 
universally and without limitation. Our expositions accordingly teach 
the reality (i.e., objective validity) of space in regard to everything that 
can come before us externally as an object, but at the same time the ideality 
of space in regard to things when they are considered in themselves 
through reason, i.e., without taking account of the constitution of 
our sensibility. We therefore assert the empirical reality of space (with 
respect to all possible outer experience), though to be sure its transcendental 
ideality, i.e., that it is nothing as soon as we leave aside the 
condition of the possibility of all experience, and take it as something 
that grounds the things in themselves. 

Besides space, however, there is no other subjective representation

relateda to something external that could be called a priori objective. 
b<For one cannot derive synthetic a priori propositions from any such 
representation, as one can from intuition in space (§ 3). Strictly speaking, 
therefore, ideality does not pertain to them, although they coincide 
with the representation of space in belonging only to the subjective 
constitution of the kind of sense, e.g., of sight, hearing, and feeling, 
through the sensations of colors, sounds, and warmth, which, however, 
since they are merely sensations and not intuitions, do not in themselves 
allow any objectC to be cognized, least of all a priori.

ples, since things like colors, taste, etc., are correctly considered not as 
qualities of things but as mere alterations of our subject, which can even 
be different in different people. For in this case that which is originally 
itself only appearance, e.g., a rose, counts in an empirical sense as a 
thing in itself, which yet can appear different to every eye in regard to 
color. The transcendental concept of appearances in space, on the contrary, 
is a critical reminder that absolutely nothing that is intuited in 


space is a thing in itself, and that space is not a form that is proper to 
anything in itself, but rather that objects in themselves are not known 
to us at all, and that what we call outer objects are nothing other than 
mere representations of our sensibility, whose form is space, but whose 
true correlate, i.e., the thing in itself, is not and cannot be cognized 
through them, but is also never asked after in experience.

not an empirical concept that is somehow drawn from an 
experience. For simultaneity or succession would not themselves come 
into perception if the representation of time did not ground them a priori. 
Only under its presupposition can one represent that several things 
exist at one and the same time (simultaneously) or in different times 
(successively) .

can very well take the appearances away from time. Time is therefore 
given a priori. In it alone is all actuality of appearances possible. The latter 
could all disappear, but time itself (as the universal condition of their 
possibility)a cannot be removed. 

3) This a priori necessity also grounds the possibility of apodictic B47 
principles of relations of time, or axioms of time in general. It has only 
one dimension: different times are not simultaneous, but successive 
(just as different spaces are not successive, but simultaneous). These 
principles could not be drawn from experience, for this would yield neither 
strict universality nor apodictic certainty. We would only be able to 
say: This is what common perception teaches, but not: This is how matters 
must stand. These principles are valid as rules under which alone 
experiences are possible at all, and instruct us prior to them, not 
through it.b 
4) Time is no discursive or, as one calls it, general concept, but a pure 
form of sensible intuition. Different times are only parts of one and the 
same time. That representation, however, which can only be given A 3 2 
through a single object, is an intuition. Further, the proposition that 
different times cannot be simultaneous cannot be derived from a general 
concept. The proposition is synthetic, and cannot arise from concepts 
alone. It is therefore immediately contained in the intuition and 
representation of time. 
5) The infinitude of time signifies nothing more than that every determinate 
magnitude of time is only possible through limitations of a B48 
single time grounding it. The original representation time must therefore 
be given as unlimited. But where the parts themselves and every 
magnitude of an object can be determinately represented only through 
limitation, there the entire representation cannot be given through 
concepts, «hfor they contain only partial representations»h,' but immediate 
intuition must ground them.d

it, the concept of motion (as alteration of place), is only possible 
through and in the representation of time -that if this representation 
were not a priori (inner) intuition, then no concept, whatever it might 
be, could make comprehensible the possibility of an alteration, i.e., of a 
combination of contradictorily opposed predicates (e.g., a thing's being 
in a place and the not-being of the very same thing in the same place) 
in one and the same object.a Only in time can both contradictorily op


B49 posed determinations in one thing be encountered, namely successively. 
Our concept of time therefore explains the possibility of as much 
synthetic apriori cognition as is presented by the general theory of motion, 
which is no less fruitful.>30 

<§ 6> 
A 32 Conclusions from these concepts. 
a) Time is not something that would subsist for itself or attach to things 
as an objective determination, and thus remain if one abstracted from 
all subjective conditions of the intuition of them; for in the first case it 
would be something that was actual yet without an actual object. As far 
A 3 3 as the second case is concerned, however, time could not precede the 
objects as a determination or order attaching to the things themselves 
as their condition and be cognized and intuited a priori through synthetic 
propositions. But the latter, on the contrary, can very well occur 
if time is nothing other than the subjective condition under which all 
intuitions can take place in us. For then this form of inner intuition can 
be represented prior to the objects, thus a priori. 
b) Time is nothing other than the form of inner sense, i.e., of the intuition 
of our self and our inner state. For time cannot be a determina-
B 50 tion of outer appearances; it belongs neither to a shape or a position, 
etc., but on the contrary determines the relation of representations in 
our inner state. And just because this inner intuition yields no shape we 
also attempt to remedy this lack through analogies, and represent the 
temporal sequence through a line progressing to infinity, in which the 
manifold constitutes a series that is of only one dimension, and infer 
from the properties of this line to all the properties of time, with the 
sole difference that the parts of the former are simultaneous but those 
of the latter always exist successively. From this it is also apparent that 
the representation of time is itself an intuition, since all its relations can 
be expressed in an outer intuition.

condition merely to outer intuitions. But since, on the contrary, all representations, 
whether or not they have outer things as their object, nevertheless 
as determinations of the mind themselves belong to the inner 
state, while this inner state belongs under the formal condition of inner 
intuition, and thus of time, so time is an a priori condition of all appearance 
in general, and indeed the immediate condition of the inner 
intuition (of our souls), and thereby also the mediate condition of outer 
appearances. If I can say a priori: all outer appearances are in space and B 5 I 
determined a priori according to the relations of space, so from the 
principlea of inner sense I can say entirely generally: all appearances in 
general, i.e., all objects of the senses, are in time, and necessarily stand 
in relations of time. 

If we abstract from our way of internally intuiting ourselves and by 
means of this intuition also dealing with all outer intuitions in the 
power of representation, and thus take objects as they may be in themselves, 
then time is nothing. It is only of objective validity in regard to 
appearances, because these are already things that we take as objects of 
our senses; but it is no longer objective if one abstracts from the sen-A35 
sibility of our intuition, thus from that kind of representation that is peculiar 
to us, and speaks of things in general. Time is therefore merely 
a subjective condition of our (human) intuition (which is always sensible, 
i.e., insofar as we are affected by objects), and in itself, outside the 
subject, is nothing. Nonetheless it is necessarily objective in regard to 
all appearances, thus also in regard to all things that can come before us 
in experience. We cannot say all things are in time, because with the 
concept of things in general abstraction is made from every kind of in-B 52 
tuition of them, but this is the real condition under which time belongs 
to the representation of objects. Now if the condition is added to the 
concept, and the principle says that all things as appearances (objects of 
sensible intuition) are in time, then the principle has its sound objective 
correctness and a priori universality. 

Our assertions accordingly teach the empirical reality of time, i.e., 
objective validity in regard to all objects that may ever be given to our 
senses. And since our intuition is always sensible, no object can ever be 
given to us in experience that would not belong under the condition of 
time. But, on the contrary, we dispute all claim of time to absolute reality, 
namely where it would attach to things absolutely as a condition 
or property even without regard to the form of our sensible intuition. A36 
Such properties, which pertain to things in themselves, can never be 
given to us through the senses. In this therefore consists the transcendental 
ideality of time, according to which it is nothing at all if one ab-

stracts from the subjective conditions of sensible intuition, and cannot 
be counted as either subsisting or inhering in the objects in themselves 
(without their relation to our intuition). Yet this ideality is to be com-

B 53 pared with the subreptions of sensation just as little as that of space is, 
because in that case one presupposes that the appearance itself, in which 
these predicates inhere, has objective reality, which is here entirely absent 
except insofar as it is merely empirical, i.e., the object itself is regarded 
merely as appearance: concerning which the above remark in 
the previous sections is to be consulted.a 

<§ 7> 
Elucidation. 


Against this theory, which concedes empirical reality to time but disputes 
its absolute and transcendental reality, insightful men have so 
unanimously proposed one objection that I conclude that it must naturally 
occur to every reader who is not accustomed to these considerationsY 
It goes thus: Alterations are real (this is proved by the change of 
our own representations, even if one would deny all outer appearances 
together with their alterations). Now alterations are possible only in 
time, therefore time is something real. There is no difficulty in answering. 
I admit the entire argument. Time is certainly something real, 
namely the real form of inner intuition. It therefore has subjective reality 
in regard to inner experience, i.e., I really have the representation of 
time and <my>b determinations in it. It is therefore to be regarded really 
not as object" but as the way of representing myself as object.d But 
if I or another being could intuit myself without this condition of sensibility, 
then these very determinations, which we now represent to ourselves 
as alterations, would yield us a cognition in which the representation 
of time and thus also of alteration would not occur at all. Its 
empirical reality therefore remains as a condition of all our experiences. 
Only absolute reality cannot be granted to it according to what has been 
adduced above. It is nothing except the form of our inner intuition.* If 

* I can, to be sure, say: my representations succeed one another; but that only 
means that we are conscious of them as in a temporal sequence, i.e., according 
to the form of inner sense. Time is not on that account something in itself, 
nor any determination objectively adhering to things.

one removes the special condition of our sensibility from it, then the 
concept of time also disappears, and it does not adhere to the objects A38 
themselves, rather merely to the subject that intuits them. 
The cause, however, on account of which this objection is so unanimously 
made, and indeed by those who nevertheless know of nothing 
convincing to object against the doctrine of the ideality of space,32 is B 55 
this. They did not expect to be able to demonstrate the absolute reality 
of space apodictically, since they were confronted by idealism, according 
to which the reality of outer objects is not capable of any strict 
proof: on the contrary, the reality of the object of our inner sense (of 
myself and my state) is immediately clear through consciousness. The 
former could have been a mere illusion, but the latter, according to 
their opinion, is undeniably something real. But they did not consider 
that both, without their reality as representations being disputed, nevertheless 
belong only to appearance, which always has two sides, one 
where the objecta is considered in itself (without regard to the way in 
which it is to be intuited, the constitution of which however must for 
that very reason always remain problematic), the other where the form 
of the intuition of this object is considered, which must not be sought 
in the object in itself but in the subject to which it appears, but which 
nevertheless really and necessarily pertains to the representation of this 
object. 
Time and space are accordingly two sources of cognition, from 
which different synthetic cognitions can be drawn apriori, of which es-A 39 
pecially pure mathematics in regard to the cognitions of space and its 
relations provides a splendid example. Both taken together are, B 56 
namely, the pure forms of all sensible intuition, and thereby make possible 
synthetic a priori propositions. But these a priori sources of cognition 
determine their own boundaries by that very fact (that they are 
merely conditions of sensibility), namely that they apply to objects 
only so far as they are considered as appearances, but do not present 
things in themselves. Those alone are the field of their validity, beyond 
which no further objective use of them takes place. This reality of 
space and time, further, leaves the certainty of experiential cognition 
untouched: for we are just as certain of that whether these forms necessarily 
adhere to the things in themselves or only to our intuition of 
these things. Those, however, who assert the absolute reality of space 
and time, whether they assume it to be subsisting or only inhering, 
must themselves come into conflict with the principlesb of experience.

For if they decide in favor of the first (which is generally the position 
of the mathematical investigators of nature), 33 then they must assume 
two eternal and infinite self-subsisting non-entities (space and time), 
which exist (yet without there being anything real) only in order to 
comprehend everything real within themselves. If they adopt the secA40 
ond position (as do some metaphysicians of nature), and hold space 
and time to be relations of appearances (next to or successive to one 
B 57 another) that are abstracted from experience though confusedly represented 
in this abstraction, then they must dispute the validity or at least 
the apodictic certainty of a priori mathematical doctrines in regard to 
real things (e.g., in space), since this certainty does not occur a posteriori, 
and on this view the a priori concepts of space and time are only 
creatures of the imagination, the origin of which must really be sought 
in experience, out of whose abstracted relations imagination has made 
something that, to be sure, contains what is general in them but that 
cannot occur without the restrictions that nature has attached to 
them.34 The first succeed in opening the field of appearances for mathematical 
assertions.a However, they themselves become very confused 
through precisely these conditions if the understanding would go beyond 
this field. The second succeed, to be sure, with respect to the latter, 
in that the representations of space and time do not stand in their 
way if they would judge of objects not as appearances but merely in relation 
to the understanding; but they can neither offer any ground for 
the possibility of a priori mathematical cognitions (since they lack a 
true and objectively valid a priori intuition), nor can they bring the 
A41 propositions of experience into necessary accord with those assertions. 


B 58 On our theory of the true constitution of these two original forms of 
sensibility both difficulties are remedied. 
Finally, that the transcendental aesthetic cannot contain more than 
these two elements, namely space and time, is clear from the fact that 
all other concepts belonging to sensibility, even that of motion, which 
unites both elements, presuppose something empirical. For this presupposes 
the perception of something movable. In space considered in 
itself there is nothing movable; hence the movable must be something 
that is found in space only through experience, thus an empirical 
datum. In the same way the transcendental aesthetic cannot count the 
concept of alteration among its a priori data; for time itself does not 
alter, but only something that is within time. For this there is required 
the perception of some existence and the succession of its determinations, 
thus experience.

on the transcendental aesthetic 
d.>a It will first be necessary to explain as distinctly as possible our 
opinion in regard to the fundamental constitution of sensible cognition A42 
in general, in order to preclude all misinterpretation of it. 
We have therefore wanted to say that all our intuition is nothing but 
the representation of appearance; that the things that we intuit are not 
in themselves what we intuit them to be, nor are their relations so constituted 
in themselves as they appear to us; and that if we remove our 
own subject or even only the subjective constitution of the senses in 
general, then all constitution, all relations of objectsb in space and time, 
indeed space and time themselves would disappear, and as appearances 
they cannot exist in themselves, but only in us. What may be the case 
with objects in themselves and abstracted from all this receptivity of our 
sensibility remains entirely unknown to us. We are acquainted with 
nothing except our way of perceiving them, which is peculiar to us, and 
which therefore does not necessarily pertain to every being, though to 
be sure it pertains to every human being. We are concerned solely with 
this. Space and time are its pure forms, sensation in general its matter. B60 
We can cognize only the former a priori, i.e., prior to all actual perception, 
and they are therefore called pure intuition; the latter, however, is 
that in our cognition that is responsible for it being called a posteriori 
cognition, i.e., empirical intuition. The former adheres to our sensibility 
absolutely necessarily, whatever sort of sensations we may have; the 
latter can be very different. Even if we could bring this intuition of ours A43 
to the highest degree of distinctness we would not thereby come any 
closer to the constitution of objects in themselves. For in any case we 
would still completely cognize only our own way of intuiting, i.e., our 
sensibility, and this always only under the conditions originally depending 
on the subject, space and time; what the objects may be in themselves 
would still never be known through the most enlightened 
cognition of their appearance, which alone is given to us. 
That our entire sensibility is nothing but the confused representation 
of things, which contains solely that which pertains to them in themselves 
but only under a heap of marks and partial representations that 
we can never consciously separate from one another, is therefore a falsification 
of the concept of sensibility and of appearance that renders

the entire theory of them useless and empty. The difference between an 
indistinct and a distinct representation is merely logical, and does not 
concern the content. Without doubt the concept of right that is used 
by the healthy understanding contains the very same things that the 
most subtle speculation can evolve out of it, only in common and practical 
use one is not conscious of these manifold representations in these 
thoughts. Thus one cannot say that the common concept is sensible and 
contains a mere appearance, for right cannot appear at all; rather its 
concept lies in the understanding and represents a constitution (the 
moral constitution) of actions that pertains to them in themselves. The 
representation of a body in intuition, on the contrary, contains nothing 
at all that could pertain to an object in itself, but merely the appearance 
of something and the way in which we are affected by it; and this receptivity 
of our cognitive capacity is called sensibility and remains 
worlds apart from the cognition of the object in itself even if one might 
see through to the very bottom of it (the appearance). 

:a61 
A44 
The Leibnizian-Wolffian philosophy has therefore directed all investigations 
of the nature and origin of our cognitions to an entirely unjust 
point of view in considering the distinction between sensibility and the 
intellectual as merely logical, since it is obviously transcendental, and 

:a62 does not concern merely the form of distinctness or indistinctness, but 
its origin and content, so that through sensibility we do not cognize the 
constitution of things in themselves merely indistinctly, but rather not 
at all, and, as soon as we take away our subjective constitution, the represented 
object" with the properties that sensible intuition attributes to 
it is nowhere to be encountered, nor can it be encountered, for it is just 
this subjective constitution that determines its form as appearance.35 

A45 We ordinarily distinguish quite well between that which is essentially 
attached to the intuition of appearances, and is valid for every human 
sense in general, and that which pertains to them only contingently because 
it is not valid for the relationb of sensibility in general but only for 
a particular situation or organization of this or that sense. And thus one 
calls the first cognition one that represents the object in itself, but the 
second one only its appearance. This distinction, however, is only empirical. 
If one stands by it (as commonly happens) and does not regard 
that empirical intuition as in turn mere appearance (as ought to happen), 
so that there is nothing to be encountered in it that pertains to 
anything in itself, then our transcendental distinction is lost, and we be

to the relation of space and time to us. With one exception to be noted, therefore, for 
the remainder of this section (I) "relation" translates Verhalmis. In the new paragraphs11 through IV added below, however, Kant again reverts to Verha/mis.

lieve ourselves to cognize things in themselves, though we have nothing 
to do with anything except appearances anywhere (in the world of 
sense), even in the deepest research into its objects. Thus, we would B63 
certainly call a rainbow a mere appearance in a sun-shower, but would 
call this rain the thing in itself, and this is correct, as long as we understand 
the latter concept in a merely physical sense, as that which in universal 
experience and all different positions relative to the senses is 
always determined thus and not otherwise in intuition. But if we consider 
this empirical object in general and, without turning to its agreement 
with every human sense, ask whether it (not the raindrops, since A46 
these, as appearances, are already empirical objects)a represents an object 
in itself, then the question of the relation of the representation to 
the object is transcendental, and not only these drops are mere appearances, 
but even their round form, indeed even the space through which 
they fall are nothing in themselves, but only mere modifications or 
foundationsb of our sensible intuition; the transcendental object,' however, 
remains unknown to us. 
The second important concern of our transcendental aesthetic is that 
it not merely earn some favor as a plausible hypothesis, but that it be as 
certain and indubitable as can ever be demanded of a theory that is to 
serve as an organon. In order to make this certainty fully convincing we 
will choose a case in which its validity can become obvious <and that B 64 
can serve to make that which has been adduced in § 3 even more clear>. 
Thus, if it were to be supposed that space and time are in themselves 
objective and conditions of the possibility of things in themselves, then 
it would be shown, first, that there is a large number of a priori apodictic 
and synthetic propositions about both, but especially about space, 
which we will therefore here investigate as our primary example. Since 
the propositions of geometry are cognized synthetically a priori and 
with apodictic certainty, I ask: Whence do you take such propositions, A47 
and on what does our understanding rely in attaining to such absolutely 
necessary and universally valid truths? There is no other way than 
through concepts or through intuitions, both of which, however, are 
given, as such, either a priori or a posteriori. The latter, namely empirical 
concepts, together with that on which they are grounded, empirical 
intuition, cannot yield any synthetic proposition except one that is also 
merely empirical, i.e., a proposition of experience; thus it can never 
contain necessity and absolute universality of the sort that is nevertheless 
characteristic of all propositions of geometry. Concerning the first 
and only means for attaining to such cognitions, however, namely 

a Objecte

through mere concepts or a priori intuitions, it is clear that from mere 
concepts no synthetic cognition but only merely analytic cognition can 
B 65 be attained. Take the proposition that with two straight lines no space 
at all can be enclosed, thus no figure is possible, and try to derive it from 
the concept of straight lines and the number two; or take the proposition 
that a figure is possible with three straight lines, and in the same 
way try to derive it from these concepts. All of your effort is in vain, and 
you see yourself forced to take refuge in intuition, as indeed geometry 

A48 always does. You thus give yourself an object in intuition; but what kind 
is this, is it a pure a priori intuition or an empirical one? If it were the 
latter, then no universally valid, let alone apodictic proposition could 
ever come from it: for experience can never provide anything of this 
sort. You must therefore give your object a priori in intuition, and 
ground your synthetic proposition on this. If there did not lie in you a 
faculty for intuiting a priori; if this subjective condition regarding form 
were not at the same time the universal a priori condition under which 
alone the object a of this (outer) intuition is itself possible; if the object 
(the triangle) were something in itself without relation to your subject: 
then how could you say that what necessarily lies in your subjective conditions 
for constructing a triangle must also necessarily pertain to the 
triangle in itself? for you could not add to your concept (of three lines) 
something new (the figure) that must thereby necessarily be encountered 
in the object, since this is given prior to your cognition and not 
through it. If, therefore, space (and time as well) were not a mere form 
of your intuition that contains a priori conditions under which alone 
things could be outer objects for you, which are nothing in themselves 
without these subjective conditions, then you could make out absolutely 
nothing synthetic and apriori about outer objects.b It is therefore indubitably 
certain and not merely possible or even probable that space and 
time, as the necessary conditions of all (outer and inner) experience, are 
merely subjective conditions of all our intuition, in relation to which 
therefore all objects are mere appearances and not things given for 
themselves in this way; about these appearances, further, much may be 
said a priori that concerns their form but nothing whatsoever about the 
things in themselves that may ground them. 
'dI. For confirmation of this theory of the ideality of outer as well as 
inner sense, thus of all objectsd of the senses, as mere appearances, this 
comment is especially useful: that everything in our cognition that belongs 
to intuition (with the exception, therefore, of the feeling of plea

nothing but mere relations,a of places in one intuition (extension), 
alteration of places (motion), and laws in accordance with which this al-B 67 
teration is determined (moving forces). But what is present in the place, 
or what it produces in the things themselves besides the alteration of 
place, is not given through these relations. Now through mere relations 
no thing in itself is cognized; it is therefore right to judge that since 
nothing is given to us through outer sense except mere representations 
of relation, outer sense can also contain in its representation only the 
relation of an object to the subject, and not that which is internal to the 
objectb in itself.36 It is exactly the same in the case of inner sense. It is 
not merely that the representations of outer sense make up the proper 
material with which we occupy our mind, but also the time in which we 
place these representations, which itself precedes the consciousness of 
them in experience and grounds the way in which we place them in 
mind as a formal condition, already contains relations of succession, of 
simultaneity, and of that which is simultaneous with succession (of that 
which persists). Now that which, as representation, can precede any act 
of thinking something is intuition and, if it contains nothing but relations, 
it is the form of intuition, which, since it does not represent anything 
except insofar as something is posited in the mind, can be nothing 
other than the way in which the mind is affected by its own activity, 
namely this positing of its representation, thus the way it is affected B68 
through itself, i.e., it is an inner sense as far as regards its form. 
Everything that is represented through a sense is to that extent always 
appearance, and an inner sense must therefore either not be admitted at 
all or else the subject, which is the object of this sense, can only be represented 
by its means as appearance, not as it would judge of itself if its 
intuition were mere self-activity, i.e., intellectual. Any difficulty in this 
depends merely on the question how a subject can internally intuit itself; 
yet this difficulty is common to every theory. Consciousness of itself 
(apperception) is the simple representation of the I, and if all of the 
manifold in the subject were given self-actively through that alone, 
then the inner intuition would be intellectual. In human beings this 
consciousness requires inner perception of the manifold that is antecedently 
given in the subject, and the manner in which this is given in 
the mind without spontaneity must be called sensibility on account of 
this difference. If the faculty for becoming conscious of oneself is to 
seek out (apprehend) that which lies in the mind, it must affect the lata

the way in which the manifold is together in the mind in the represenB69

as it appears, that is not to say that these objects would be a mere illusion.

we attribute to them, are always regarded as something really given, 
only insofar as this property depends only on the kind of intuition of the

is to be distinguished from itself as object! in itself. Thus I

only seemsh to be given ifI assert that the quality of space and time -in 
accordance with which, as condition of their existence, I posit both of 
these -lies in my kind of intuition and not in these objectsi in themselves.

the senses or in general to the subject, e.g., the two handles that were originally 
attributed to Saturn. VVhat is not to be encountered in the object' in itself 
at all, but is always to be encountered in its relation to the subject and is 
inseparable from the representation of the object, is appearance, and thus the 
predicates of space and of time are rightly attributed to the objects of the 
senses as such, and there is no illusion in this. On the contrary, if I attribute 
the redness to the rose in itself, the handles to Saturn or extension to all outer 
objects in themselves, without looking to a determinate relation of these objects 
to the subject and limiting my judgment to this, then illusion first arises.

our principle of the ideality of all of our sensible intuitions; rather, if 
one ascribes objective reality to those forms of representation then 
one cannot avoid thereby transforming everything into mere illusion. 
For if one regards space and time as properties that, as far as their possibility 
is concerned, must be encountered in things in themselves, and 
reflects on the absurdities in which one then becomes entangled, because 
two infinite things that are neither substances nor anything really 
inhering in substances must nevertheless be something existing, indeed 
the necessary condition of the existence of all things, which also remain B 71 
even if all existing things are removed; then one cannot well blame the 
good Berkeley if he demotes bodies to mere illusion;38 indeed even our 
own existence, which would be made dependent in such a way on the 
self-subsisting reality of a non-entity such as time, would be transformed 
along with this into mere illusion; an absurdity of which no one 
has yet allowed himself to be guilty. 

Iv. In natural theology, where one conceives of an object that is not 
only not an object of intuition for us but cannot even be an object of 
sensible intuition for itself, one is careful to remove the conditions of 
time and space from all of its intuition (for all of its cognition must be 
intuition and not thinking, which is always proof of limitations). But 
with what right can one do this if one has antecedently made both of 
these into forms of things in themselves, and indeed ones that, as a priori 
conditions of the existence of things, would remain even if one removed 
the things themselves? -for as conditions of all existence in 
general they would also have to be conditions of the existence of God. 
If one will not make them into objective forms of all things, then no al-B 72 
ternative remains but to make them into subjective forms of our kind of 
outer as well as inner intuition, which is called sensible because it is not 
original, i.e., one through which the existence of the objectb of intuition 
is itself given (and that, so far as we can have insight, can only pertain 
to the original being); rather it is dependent on the existence of the 
object,c thus it is possible only insofar as the representational capacity of 
the subject is affected through that.39

It is also not necessary for us to limit the kind of intuition in space"hand time to the sensibility of human beings; it may well be that all finite 
thinking beings must necessarily agree with human beings in this regard 
(though we cannot decide this), yet even given such universal validity

1. 
On logic in general. 
Our cognition arises from two fundamental sources in the mind, the 
first of which is the reception of representations (the receptivity of impressions), 
the second the faculty for cognizing an object by means of 
these representations (spontaneity of concepts); through the former an 
object is given to us, through the latter it is thought in relation to that 
representation (as a mere determination of the mind). Intuition and 
concepts therefore constitute the elements of all our cognition, so that 
neither concepts without intuition corresponding to them in some way 
nor intuition without concepts cana yield a cognition. Both are either 
pure or empirical. Empirical, if sensation (which presupposes the actual 
presence of the object) is contained therein; but pure if no sensation 
is mixed into the representation. One can call the latter the matter 
of sensible cognition. Thus pure intuition contains merely the form B 75 
under which something is intuited, and pure concept only the form of A5I 
thinking of an object in general. Only pure intuitions or concepts alone 
are possible a priori, empirical ones only a posteriori. 
If we will call the receptivity of our mind to receive representations 
insofar as it is affected in some way sensibility, then on the contrary the 
faculty for bringing forth representations itself, or the spontaneity of 
cognition, is the understanding. It comes along with our nature that 
intuition can never be other than sensible, i.e., that it contains only 
the way in which we are affected by objects. The faculty for thinking 
of objects of sensible intuition, on the contrary, is the understanding. 
Neither of these properties is to be preferred to the other. Without sensibility 
no object would be given to us, and without understanding none 
would be thought. Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions

without concepts are blind.I It is thus just as necessary to make the 
mind's concepts sensible (i.e., to add an object to them in intuition) as 
it is to make its intuitions understandable (i.e., to bring them under 
concepts). Further, these two faculties or capacities cannot exchange 
their functions. The understanding is not capable of intuiting anything, 
and the senses are not capable of thinking anything. Only from their 
unification can cognition arise. But on this account one must not mix 
up their roles, rather one has great cause to separate them carefully 
from each other and distinguish them. Hence we distinguish the science 
of the rules of sensibility in general, i.e., aesthetic, from the science of 
the rules of understanding in general, i.e., logic. 

Now logic in turn can be undertaken with two different aims, either as 
the logic of the general or of the particular use of the understanding. The 
former contains the absolutely necessary rules of thinking, without which 
no use of the understanding takes place, and it therefore concerns these 
rules without regard to the difference of the objects to which it may be 
directed.2 The logic of the particular use of the understanding contains 
the rules for correctly thinking about a certain kind of objects. The former 
can be called elementary logic, the latter, however, the organon of 
this or that science. In the schools the latter is often stuck before the sciences 
as their propaedeutic, though in the course of human reason they 
are certainly the latest to be reached, once the science is already long 
complete, and requires only the final touch for its improvement and perfection. 
For one must already know the objects rather well if one will 

B 77 offer the rules for how a science of them is to be brought about. 

Now general logic is either pure or applied logic. In the former we 
A 53 abstract from all empirical conditions under which our understanding 
is exercised, e.g., from the influence of the senses, from the play of 


imagination," the laws of memory, the power of habit, inclination, etc., 
hence also from the sources of prejudice, indeed in general from all 
causes from which certain cognitions arise or may be supposed to arise, 
because these merely concern the understanding under certain circumstances 
of its application, and experience is required in order to know 
these. A general but pure logic therefore has to do with strictly a priori 
principles/ and is a canon of the understanding and reason, but 
only in regard to what is formal in their use, be the content what it may 
(empirical or transcendental). A general logic, however, is then called 
applied if it is directed to the rules of the use of the understanding 

under the subjective empirical conditions that psychology teaches us. It 
therefore has empirical principles/ although it is to be sure general in-

Introduction 

sofar as it concerns the use of the understanding without regard to the 
difference of objects. On this account it is also neither a canon of the 
understanding in general nor an organon of particular sciences, but B 78 
merely a cathartic of the common understanding. 

In general logic the part that is to constitute the pure doctrine of reason 
must therefore be entirely separated from that which constitutes 
applied (though still general) logic. The former alone is properly sci-A54 
ence, although brief and dry, as the scholastically correct presentation 
of a doctrine of the elements of the understanding requires. In this 
therefore logicians must always have two rules in view. 

I) As general logic it abstracts from all contents of the cognition of 
the understanding and of the difference of its objects, and has to do with 
nothing but the mere form of thinking. 
2) As pure logic it has no empirical principles,a thus it draws nothing 
from psychology (as one has occasionally been persuaded), which therefore 
has no influence at all on the canon of the understanding. It is a 
proven doctrine, and everything in it must be completely a priori. 
What I call applied logic (in opposition to the common signification 
of this word, according to which it ought to contain certain exercises to 
which pure logic gives the rule) is thus a representation of the understanding 
and the rules of its necessary use in concreto, namely under the 
contingent conditions of the subject, which can hinder or promote this B 79 
use, and which can all be given only empirically. It deals with attention, 
its hindrance and consequences, the cause of error, the condition of 
doubt, of reservation, of conviction, etc., and general and pure logic is 
related to it as pure morality, which contains merely the necessary moral A5 5 
laws of a free will in general, is related to the doctrine of virtue proper, 
which assesses these laws under the hindrances of the feelings, inclinations, 
and passions to which human beings are more or less subject, and 
which can never yield a true and proven science, since it requires empirical 
and psychological principlesb just as much as that applied logic does. 

II. 

On transcendental logic. 


General logic abstracts, as we have shown, from all content of cognition, 
i.e. from any relation C of it to the object,d and considers only the 

a Principien 
b Principien 

, Beziehung. The contrast between this term and the following use of Verhdltnis (p. 196, 
note a) shows that Kant continues to use the former to connote a relation between subject 
and object and the latter among objects, thuugh in this case objects of thought 
rather than sensibility. Further, unnoted instances of "relation" translate Beziehung. 

d Object

logical form in the relationa of cognitions to one another, i.e., the form 
of thinking in general. But now since there are pure as well as empirical 
intuitions (as the transcendental aesthetic proved), a distinction be-
B 80 tween pure and empirical thinking of objects could also well be found. 
In this case there would be a logic in which one did not abstract from 
all content of cognition; for that logic that contained merely the rules 
of the pure thinking of an object would exclude all those cognitions that 
were of empirical content. It would therefore concern the origin of our 


A56 cognitions of objects insofar as that cannot be ascribed to the objects; 
while general logic, on the contrary, has nothing to do with this origin 
of cognition, but rather considers representations, whether they are 
originally given a priori in ourselves or only empirically, merely in respect 
of the laws according to which the understanding brings them 
into relationb to one another when it thinks, and therefore it deals only 
with the form of the understanding, which can be given to the representations 
wherever they may have originated. 
And here I make a remark the import of which extends to all of the 
following considerations, and that we must keep well in view, namely 
that not every a priori cognition must be called transcendental, but only 
that by means of which we cognize that and how certain representations 
(intuitions or concepts) are applied entirely a priori, or are possible (i.e., 

B 81 the possibility of cognition or its use a priori). Hence neither space nor 
any geometrical determination of it a priori is a transcendental representation, 
but only the cognition that these representations are not of 
empirical origin at all and the possibility that they can' nevertheless be 
related a priori to objects of experience can be called transcendental. 
Likewise the use of space about all objects in general would also be 
transcendental; but if it is restricted solely to objects of the senses, then 

A 57 it is called empirical. The difference between the transcendental and 
the empirical therefore belongs only to the critique of cognitions and 
does not concern their relation to their object. 
In the expectation, therefore, that there can perhaps be concepts that 
may be related to objects a priori, not as pure or sensible intuitions but 
rather merely as acts of pure thinking, that are thus concepts but of neither 
empirical nor aesthetic origin, we provisionally formulate the idea 
of a science of pure understanding and of the pure cognition of reason, 
by means of which we think objects completely a priori. Such a science, 
which would determine the origin, the domain, and the objective validity 
of such cognitions, would have to be called transcendental logic, 
since it has to do merely with the laws of the understanding and reason,

but solely insofar as they are related to objects a priori and not, as in the B 82 
case of general logic, to empirical as well as pure cognitions of reason 
without distinction. 
III. 
On the division of general logic 
into analytic and dialectic. 
The old and famous question with which the logicians were to be driven 
into a corner and brought to such a pass that they must either fall 
into a miserable circlea or else confess their ignorance, hence the van-A58 
ity of their entire art, is this: What is truth? The nominal definition of 
truth, namely that it is the agreement of cognition with its object, is 
here granted and presupposed; but one demands to know what is the 
general and certain criterion of the truth of any cognition. 
It is already a great and necessary proof of cleverness or insight to 
know what one should reasonably ask. For if the question is absurd in 
itself and demands unnecessary answers, then, besides the embarrassment 
of the one who proposes it, it also has the disadvantage of misleading 
the incautious listener into absurd answers, and presenting the 
ridiculous sight (as the ancients said) of one person milking a billy-goat B83 
while the other holds a sieve underneath.3 
If truth consists in the agreement of a cognition with its object, then 
this object must thereby be distinguished from others; for a cognition 
is false if it does not agree with the object to which it is related even if 
it contains something that could well be valid of other objects. Now a 
general criterion of truth would be that which was valid of all cognitions 
without any distinction among their objects. But it is clear that since 
with such a criterion one abstracts from all content of cognition (relation 
to its object), b yet truth concerns precisely this content, it would be A59 
completely impossible and absurd to ask for a mark of the truth of this 
content of cognition, and thus it is clear that a sufficient and yet at the 
same time general sign of truth cannot possibly be provided. Since 
above we have called the content of a cognition its matter, one must 
therefore say that no general sign of the truth of the matter of cognition 
can be demanded, because it is self-contradictory. 
But concerning the mere form of cognition (setting aside all content), 
it is equally clear that a logic, so far as it expounds the general and nec-B 84 
essary rules of understanding, must present criteria of truth in these 
very rules. For that which contradicts these is false, since the understanding 
thereby contradicts its general rules of thinking and thus conn

tradicts itself. But these criteria concern only the form of truth, i.e., of 
thinking in general, and are to that extent entirely correct but not sufficient. 
For although a cognition may be in complete accord with logical 
form, i.e., not contradict itself, yet it can still always contradict the 
object. The merely logical criterion of truth, namely the agreement of 
a cognition with the general and formal laws of understanding and reason, 
is therefore certainly the conditio sine qua non and thus the negative 
condition of all truth; further, however, logic cannot go, and the error 
that concerns not form but content cannot be discovered by any touchstone 
of logic.4 

General logic analyzes the entire formal business of the understanding 
and reason into its elements, and presents these as principlesa of all 
logical assessmentb of our cognition. This part of logic can therefore be 
called an analytic, and is on that very account at least the negative 
touchstone of truth, since one must before all else examine and evaluate 
by means of these rules the form of all cognition before investigating 
its content in order to find out whether with regard to the object it 
contains positive truth. But since the mere form of cognition, however 
well it may agree with logical laws, is far from sufficing to constitute the 
material (objective) truth of the cognition, nobody can dare to judge of 
objects and to assert anything about them merely with logic without 
having drawn on antecedently well-founded information about them 
from outside oflogic, in order subsequently merely to investigate its use 
and connection in a coherent whole according to logical laws, or, better, 
solely to examine them according to such laws. Nevertheless there 
is something so seductive in the possession of an apparent art for giving 
all of our cognitions the form of understanding, even though with re


A6r gard to their content one may yet be very empty and poor, that this general 
logic, which is merely a canon for judging,c has been used as if it 
were an organon for the actual production of at least the semblance of 
objective assertions, and thus in fact it has thereby been misused. Now 
general logic, as a putative organon, is called dialectic. 

B 86 
As different as the significance of the employment of this designation 
of a science or art among the ancients may have been, one can still infer 
from their actual use of it that among them it was nothing other than 
the logic of illusion a sophistical art for giving to its ignorance, in


-

deed even to its intentional tricks, the air of truth, by imitating the 
method of thoroughness, which logic prescribes in general, and using 
its topics for the embellishment of every empty pretension. Now one 
can take it as a certain and useful warning that general logic, consid-

N Principien 

b Beurtheilung 


, Beurtheilung

Introduction 

ered as an organon, is always a logic of illusion, i.e., is dialectical. For 
since it teaches us nothing at all about the content of cognition, but 
only the formal conditions of agreement with the understanding, which 
are entirely indifferent with regard to the objects, the effrontery of 
using it as a tool (organon) for an expansion and extension of its information,
a or at least the pretension of so doing, comes down to nothing 
but idle chatter, asserting or impeaching whatever one wants with some A62 
plausibility. 

Such instruction by no means befits the dignity of philosophy. For 
this reason it would be better to take this designation of "dialectic" as a 
critique of dialectical illusion, which is counted as part of logic, and 
in such a way we would here have it be understood. 

Tv. B87 
On the division of transcendental logic into 
the transcendental analytic and dialectic. 
In a transcendental logic we isolate the understanding (as we did above 
with sensibility in the transcendental aesthetic), and elevate from our 
cognition merely the part of our thought that has its origin solely in the 
understanding. The use of this pure cognition, however, depends on 
this as its condition: that objects are given to us in intuition, to which it 
can be applied. For without intuition all of our cognition would lack objects,
b and therefore remain completely empty. The part of transcendental 
logic, therefore, that expounds the elements of the pure 
cognition of the understanding and the principlesc without which no 
object can be thought at all, is the transcendental analytic, and at the 
same time a logic of truth. For no cognition can contradict it without at 
the same time losing all content, i.e., all relation to any object,d hence A63 
all truth. But because it is very enticing and seductive to make use of 
these pure cognitions of the understanding and principles by themselves, 
and even beyond all bounds of experience, which however itself 
alone can give us the matter (objects)' to which those pure concepts of B88 
the understanding can be applied, the understanding falls into the danger 
of making a material use of the merely formal principles! of pure 
understanding through empty sophistries, and of judging without distinction 
about objects that are not given to us, which perhaps indeed

could not be given to us in any way. Since it should properly be only a 
canon for the assessment of empirical use, it is misused if one lets it 
count as the organon of a general and unrestricted use, and dares to 
synthetically judge, assert, and decide about objects in general with the 
pure understanding alone. The use of the pure understanding would in 


this case therefore be dialectical. The second part of the transcendental 
logic must therefore be a critique of this dialectical illusion, and is called 
transcendental dialectic, not as an art of dogmatically arousing such illusion 
(an unfortunately highly prevalent art among the manifold works 
of metaphysical jugglery), but rather as a critique of the understanding 
and reason in regard to their hyperphysical use, in order to uncover the 
A 64 false illusion of their groundless pretensions and to reduce their claims 
to invention and amplification, putatively to be attained through transcendental 
principles, to the mere assessment and evaluation of the pure

The Transcendental Analytic 
This Analytic is the analysisa of the entirety of our a priori cognition 
into the elements of the pure cognition of the understanding. It is concerned 
with the following points: I.b That the concepts be pure and not 
empirical concepts. 2. That they belong not to intuition and to sensibility, 
but rather to thinking and understanding. 3. That they be elementary 
concepts, and clearly distinguished from those which are 
derived or composed from them. 4. That the table of them be complete, 
and that they entirely exhaust the entire field of pure understanding. 
Now this completeness of a science cannot reliably be assumed from a 
rough calculation of an aggregate put together by mere estimates; 
hence it is possible only by means of an idea of the whole of the apriori 
cognition of the understanding, and throughC the division of concepts 
that such an idea determines and that constitutes it, thus only 
through their connection in a system. The pure understanding sepaA6S 
rates itself completely not only from everything empirical, but even 
from all sensibility. It is therefore a unity that subsists on its own, which 
is sufficient by itself, and which is not to be supplemented by any ex-B90 
ternal additions. Hence the sum total of its cognition will constitute a 
system that is to be grasped and determined under one idea, the completeness 
and articulation of which system can at the same time yield a 
touchstone of the correctness and genuineness of all the pieces of cognition 
fitting into it. This whole part of the transcendental logic, however, 
consists of two books, the first of which contains the concepts of 
pure understanding, the second its principles.

synthetic a posteriori propositions are possible is not to be regarded as a question requiring 
a solution, since it is a fact. 
"Now it is to be asked how this fact is possible. 

"Experience consists of judgments, but it is to be asked whether these empirical 
judgments do not in the end presuppose a priori (pure) judgments. The analysis

are in it; second, beyond the a posteriori concepts also a priori concepts. 

"The problem is: How is experience possible? 1. vVhat does the understanding do 
in judgments in general? 2. What do the senses do in empirical judgments? 3. In empirical

"The test for whether something is also experience, i.e., a fact, is as it were experimentation

where they lie ready, until with the opportunity of experience

The Analytic of Concepts 
First Chapter 
On the Clue to the Discovery of all 
Pure Concepts of the Understanding 


If one sets a faculty of cognition into play, then on various occasions different 
concepts will become prominent that will make this faculty 
known and that can be collected in a more or less exhaustive treatise depending 
on whether they have been observed for a longer time or with 
greater acuteness. Where this investigation will be completed can never 
be determined with certainty by means of this as it were mechanical 
procedure. Further, the concepts that are discovered only as the opporA67 
tunity arises will not reveal any order and systematic unity, but will 

B 92 rather be ordered in pairs only according to similarities and placed in 
series only in accord with the magnitude of their content, from the simple 
to the more composite, which series are by no means systematic 
even if to some extent methodically produced. 
Transcendental philosophy has the advantage but also the obligation 
to seek its concepts in accordance with a principle,a since they spring 
pure and unmixed from the understanding, as absolute unity, and must 
therefore be connected among themselves in accordance with a concept 
or idea. Such a connection, however, provides a rule by means of which 
the place of each pure concept of the understanding and the completeness 
of all of them together can be determined a priori, which would 
otherwise depend upon whim or chance.

pendently of sensibility. The understanding is therefore not a faculty of 
intuition. But besides intuition there is no other kind of cognition than B 93 
through concepts. Thus the cognition of every, at least human, understanding 
is a cognition through concepts, not intuitive but discursive. 
All intuitions, as sensible, rest on affections, concepts therefore on 
functions. By a function, however, I understand the unity of the action 
of ordering different representations under a common one. Concepts 
are therefore grounded on the spontaneity of thinking, as sensible intuitions 
are grounded on the receptivity of impressions. Now the understanding 
can make no other use of these concepts than that of judging 
by means of them. Since noa representation pertains to the object immediately 
except intuition alone, a concept is thus never immediately 
related to an object, but is always related to some other representation 
of it (whether that be an intuition or itself already a concept).b Judgment 
is therefore the mediate cognition of an object, hence the representation 
of a representation of it. In every judgment there is a concept that 
holds of many, and that among this many also comprehends a given 
representation, which is then related immediately to the object.5 So in 
the judgment, e.g., "All bodies are divisible,"c the concept of the divisible 
is related to various other concepts; among these, however, it is 
here particularly related to the concept of body, and this in turn is related 
to certain appearances d that come before us. These objects are A69 
therefore mediately represented by the concept of divisibility. All judg-B 94 
ments are accordingly functions of unity among our representations, 
since instead of an immediate representation a higher one, which comprehends 
this and other representations under itself, is used for the cognition 
of the object, and many possible cognitions are thereby drawn 
together into one. We can, however, trace all actions of the understanding 
back to judgments, so that the understanding in general can 
be represented as a faculty for judging. For according to what has been 
said above it is a faculty for thinking. Thinking is cognition through 
concepts. Concepts, however, as predicates of possible judgments, are 
related to some representation of a still undetermined object. The concept 
of body thus signifies something, e.g., metal, which can be cognized 
through that concept. It is therefore a concept only because other 
representations are contained under it by means of which it can be rea

lated to objects. It is therefore the predicate for a possible judgment, 
e.g., "Every metal is a body." The functions of the understanding can 
therefore all be found together if one can exhaustively exhibit the functions 
of unity in judgments. The following section will make it evident 
that this can readily be accomplished.

If we abstract from all content of a judgment in general, and attend only 
to the mere form of the understanding in it, we find that the function 
of thinking in that can be brought under four titles, each of which contains 
under itself three moments. They can suitably be represented in 
the following table.6

Section II. On the logical function in judgments 

I. The logicians rightly say that in the use of judgments in syllogisms 
singular judgments can be treated like universal ones. For just because 
they have no domain at all, their predicate is not merely related to some 
of what is contained under the concept of the subject while being excluded 
from another part of it. The predicate therefore holds of that 
concept without exception, just as if the latter were a generally valida 
concept with a domain with the predicate applying to the whole of what 
is signified. bIf, on the contrary, we compare a singular judgment with a 
generally valid one, merely as cognition, with respect to quantity," then 
the formerd relates to the latter as unity relates to infinity, and is therefore 
in itself essentially different from the latter. Therefore, if! consider 
a singular judgment (judicium singulare) not only with respect to its 
internal validity, but also, as cognition in general, with respect to the 
quantitye it has in comparison with other cognitions, then it is surely i 
different from generally valid judgments (judicia communia), and deserves 
a special place in a complete table of the moments of thinking in 
general (though obviously not in that logic that is limited only to the B 97 
use of judgments with respect to each other). 
2. Likewise, in a transcendental logic infinite judgments must also 
be distinguished from affirmative ones, even though in general logic A72 
they are rightly included with the latter and do not constitute a special 
member of the classification. General logic abstracts from all content of 
the predicate (even if it is negative), and considers only whether it is attributed 
to the subject or opposed to it. Transcendental logic, however, 
also considers the value or content of the logical affirmation made in a 
judgment by means of a merely negative, predicate, and what sort of 
gain this yields for the whole of cognition,Jf I had said of the soul that 
it is not mortal, then I would at least have avoided an error by means of 
a negative judgment. Now by means of the proposition "The soul is not 
mortal" I have certainly made an actual affirmation as far as logical form 
is concerned, for I have placed the soul within the unlimited domain of 
undying beings. Now since that which is mortal contains one part of the 
whole domain of possible beings, but that which is undying! the other, 
a ge11leingiiltiger. While this would normally be translated "commonly valid," in this context 
it clearly refers to the universal (allge11lein) judgment; we have used "generally" to 
preserve this reference while still marking the difference from allge11lein. 

b von dessen ganzer Bedeutung; here Kant uses Bedeutung, as Frege was later to use it, to 
mean the reference or denotation of a concept; more typically, he uses it to mean something 
closer to what Frege called Sinn or sense, that is, the connotation.

d The text has sie rather than es, but in spite of the shift in gender there is nothing for the 
pronoun to refer to except "a singular judgment."

f In the second edition, Nichtsterbende; in the first, Nichtsterbliche, or "immortal." 


207 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. 1. Bk I. Ch. I 

nothing is said by my proposition but that the soul is One of the infinite 
multitude of things that remain if I take away everything that is mortal. 
But the infinite sphere of the possible is thereby limited only to the extent 
that that which is mortal is separated from it, and the soul is placed 
B 98 in the remaining space of its domain.a But even with this exception this 
space still remains infinite, and more parts could be taken away from it 

A73 without the concept of the soul growing in the least and being affirmatively 
determined. In regard to logical domain, therefore, this infinite 
judgment is merely limiting with regard to the COntent of cognition in 
general, and to this extent it must not be omitted from the transcendental 
table of all moments of thinking in judgments, since the function 
of understanding that is hereby exercised may perhaps be important in 
the field of its pure a priori cognition.7 

3. All relationsb of thinking in judgments are those a) of the predicate 
to the subject, b) of the ground to the consequence, and c) between the 
cognition that is to be divided andc all of the members of the division. 
In the first kind of judgment only two concepts are considered to be in 
relation to each other, in the second, two judgments, and in the third, 
several judgments. The hypothetical proposition "If there is perfect justice, 
then obstinate evil will be punished" really contains the relation of 
two propositions, "There is a perfect justice" and "Obstinate evil is punished." 
Whether both of these propositions in themselves are true remains 
unsettled here. It is only the implication that is thought by means 
of this judgment. Finally, the disjunctive judgment contains the relations 
of two or more propositions to One another, though not the relation of 
sequence, but rather that of logical opposition, insofar as the sphere of 
one judgment excludes that of the other, yet at the same time the relation 
of community, insofar as the judgments together exhaust the sphere 
A74 of cognition proper; it is therefore a relation of the parts of the sphere 
of a cognition where the sphere of each part is the complement of that 
of the others in the sum total of the divided cognition, e.g., "The world 
exists either through blind chance, or through inner necessity, or 
through an external cause." Each of these propositions occupies one 
part of the sphere of the possible cognition about the existence of a 
world in general, and together they occupy the entire sphere. To remove 
the cognition from one of these spheres means to place it in one of the 

a Following the first edition, Raum ihres Umfangs, rather than the second, Umfangs ihres 
Raums. 

b Verhaltnisse; although he is now speaking of the functions of judgment the table had 
listed under the latinate heading Relation, Kant now reverts to Verhaltnis, and in the remainder 
of this paragraph Verhaltnis is translated by "relation." Kant's reversion to 
Verhaltnis here is consistent with his use of this term elsewhere, since he is talking of the 
relation of parts of judgments to each other rather than to us.

others, and to place it in one sphere, on the contrary, means to remove 
it from the others. In a disjunctive judgment there is therefore a certain 
community of cognitions, consisting in the fact that they mutually exclude 
each other, yet thereby determine the true cognition in its entirety, 
since taken together they constitute the entire content of a 
particular given cognition.8 And this is also all that I find it necessary to 
remark upon for the sake of what follows." 

4. The modality of judgments is a quite special function of them, 
which is distinctive in that it contributes nothing to the content of the B roo 
judgment (for besides quantity, quality, and relationb there is nothing 
more that constitutes the content of a judgment), but rather concerns 
only the value of the copula in relation to thinking in genera1.9 
Problematic judgments are those in which one regards the assertion 6fdenial 
as merely possible (arbitrary). Assertoric judgments are those in 
which it is considered actual (true). Apodictic judgments are those in A75 
which it is seen as necessary. * Thus the two judgments whose relation 
constitutes the hypothetical judgment (antecedens and consequens), as well 
as those in whose reciprocal relatione the disjunctive judgment consists 
(the members of the division), are all merely problematic. In the above 
example the proposition "There is a perfect justice" is not said assertorically, 
but is only thought of as an arbitrary judgment that it is possible 
that someone might assume, and only the implication is assertoric. Thus 
such judgments can be obviously false and yet, if taken problematically, 
conditions of the cognition of truth. Thus the judgment "The world 
exists through blind chance" is of only problematic significance in the 
disjunctive judgment, that is, someone might momentarily assume this BIOI 
proposition, and yet it serves (like the designation of the false path 
among the number of all of those one can take) to find the true one. The 
problematic proposition is therefore that which only expresses logical 
possibility (which is not objective), i.e., a free choice to allow such a 
proposition to count as valid, a merely arbitrary assumption of it in the 
understanding. The assertoric proposition speaks of logical actuality or 
truth, as say in a hypothetical syllogism the antecedent in the major A 76 
premise is problematic, but that in the minor premise assertoric, and in* 
It is just as if in the first case thought were a function of the understanding, 
in the second of the power of judgment, and in the third of reason. This is 
a remark the elucidation of which can be expected only in the sequel. 
n 

The following note occurs in Kant's copy of the first edition: "Judgments and propositions 
are different. That the latter are verbis expressa [explicit words]n, since they are assertoric" 
(E XXXVIII, p. 23; 23:25). 

b Verhdltnis

dicates that the proposition is already bound to the understanding according 
to its laws; the apodictic proposition thinks of the assertoric one 
as determined through these laws of the understanding itself, and as 
thus asserting a priori, and in this way expresses logical necessity. Now 
since everything here is gradually incorporated into the understanding, 
so that one first judges something problematically, then assumes it assertorically 
as true, and finally asserts it to be inseparably connected 
with the understanding, i.e., asserts it as necessary and apodictic, these 
three functions of modality can also be called so many moments of 
thinking in general. 

BI02 On the Clue to the Discovery of all Pure 
Concepts of the Understanding 
Third Section 

<§ IO.> 
On the pure concepts of the understanding 
or categories. 


As has already been frequently said, general logic abstracts from all content 
of cognition, and expects that representations will be given to it 
from elsewhere, wherever this may be, in order for it to transform them 
into concepts analytically. Transcendental logic, on the contrary, has a 
manifold of sensibility that lies before it a priori, which the transcen-

A 77 dental aesthetic has offered to it, in order to provide the pure concepts 
of the understanding with a matter, without which they would be without 
any content, thus completely empty. Now space and time contain a 
manifold of pure a priori intuition, but belong nevertheless among the 
conditions of the receptivity of our mind, under which alone it can receive 
representations of objects, and thus they must always also affect 
the concept of these objects. Only the spontaneity of our thought requires 
that this manifold first be gone through, taken up, and combined 
in a certain way in order for a cognition to be made out of it. I call this 
action synthesis. 

E I03 By synthesis in the most general sense, however, I understanda the 
action of putting different representations together with each other and 
comprehending their manifoldness in one cognition. Such a synthesis is 
pure if the manifold is given not empirically but a priori (as is that in 
space and time). Prior to all analysis of our representations these must 
first be given, and no concepts can arise analytically as far as the COll


a In his copy of the first edition, Kant changes this sentence to this point to "1 understand 
by synthesis, however, the action through which synthetic judgments come to be, 
in the general sense, .n.. " (E XXXIX, p. 23; 23'45). Kant also adds the words 
"Combination, composition, and nexus" (E XL, p. 24)· 

210 



Section III. On the pure concepts of the understanding a 

tent is concerned. The synthesis of a manifold, however, (whether it 
be given empirically or a priorz) first brings forth a cognition, which to 
be sure may initially still be raw and confused, and thus in need of 
analysis; yet the synthesis alone is that which properly collects the elements 
for cognitions and unifies them into a certain content; it is there-A78 
fore the first thing to which we have to attend if we wish to judge about 
the first origin of our cognition. 

Synthesis in general is, as we shall subsequently see, the mere effect 
of the imagination, of a blind though indispensable function of the 
souI,b without which we would have no cognition at all, but of which we 
are seldom even conscious. Yet to bring this synthesis to concepts is a 
function that pertains to the understanding, and by means of which it 
first provides cognition in the proper sense." 

Now pure synthesis, generally represented, yields the pure con-B I04 
cept of the understanding. By this synthesis, however, I understand that 
which rests on a ground of synthetic unity a priori; thus our counting (as 
is especially noticeable in the case of larger numbers) is a synthesis in 
accordance with concepts, since it takes place in accordance with a 
common ground of unity (e.g., the decad). Under this concept, therefore, 
the synthesis of the manifold becomes necessary. 

Different representations are brought under one concept analytically 
(a business treated by general logic). Transcendental logic, however, 
teaches how to bring under concepts not the representations but 
the pure synthesis of representations. The first thing that must be 
given to us a priori for the cognition of all objects is the manifold of 
pure intuition; the synthesis of this manifold by means of the imagi-A79 
nation is the second thing, but it still does not yield cognition. The 
concepts that give this pure sythesis unity, and that consist solely in the 
representation of this necessary synthetic unity, are the third thing necessary 
for cognition of an object that comes before us, and they depend 
on the understanding. 10 

The same function that gives unity to the different representations in 
a judgment also gives unity to the mere synthesis of different repre-BIOS 
sentations in an intuition, which, expressed generally, is called the pure 
concept of understanding. I I The same understanding, therefore, and indeed 
by means of the very same actions through which it brings the logical 
form of a judgment into concepts by means of the analytical unity, 
also brings a transcendental content into its representations by means of

the synthetic unity of the manifold in intuition in general, on account of 
which they are called pure concepts of the understanding that pertain to 
objects a a priori; this can never be accomplished by universal logic. 

In such a way there arise exactly as many pure concepts of the understanding, 
which apply to objects of intuition in general a priori, as 
there were logical functions of all possible judgments in the previous 
table: for the understanding is completely exhausted and its capacityb 
entirely measured by these functions.c Following Aristotle we will call 

A80 these concepts categories, for our aim is basically identical with his although 
very distant from it in execution.d

Section III. On the pure concepts of the understanding 

Now this is the listing of all original pure concepts of synthesisa that 
the understanding contains in itself a priori, and on account of which it 
is only a pure understanding; for by these concepts alone can it understand 
something in the manifold of intuition, i.e., think an objectb for 
it. This division is systematically generated from a common principle," 
namely the faculty for judging (which is the same as the faculty for A8I 
thinking), and has not arisen rhapsodically from a haphazard search for 
pure concepts, of the completeness of which one could never be certain, B 107 
since one would only infer it through induction, without reflecting that 
in this way one would never see why just these and not other concepts 
should inhabit the pure understanding. ruistotle's search for these fundamental 
concepts was an effort worthy of an acute man. But since he 
had no principle,d he rounded them up as he stumbled on them, and 
first got up a list of ten of them, which he called categories (predicaments). 
Subsequently he believed that he had found five more of them, 
which he added under the name of post-predicaments. But his table still 
had holes. Further, it also included several modi of pure sensibility 
(quando, ubi, situs, as well as prius, simul,)e as well as an empirical one 
(motus)/ which do not belong in this ancestral registryg of the understanding; 
derivative concepts were also included among the primary 
ones (actio, passio),h and several of the latter were entirely missing. 

For the sake of the primary concepts it is therefore still necessary to 
remark that the categories, as the true ancestral conceptsi of pure understanding, 
also have their equally pure derivativej concepts, which 
could by no means be passed over in a complete system of transcendental 
philosophy, but with the mere mention of which I can be satis-A82 
fied in a merely critical essay. 

Let me be allowed to call these pure but derivative concepts the B 108 
predicables of pure understanding (in contrast to the predicaments). If 
one has the original and primitive concepts, the derivative and subalternate 
ones can easily be added, and the family treek of pure understanding 
fully illustrated. Since I am concerned here not with the

completeness of the system but rather only with the principlesa for a 
system, I reserve this supplementation for another job. But one could 
readily reach this aim if one took the ontological textbooks in hand, 
and, e.g., under the category of causality, subordinated the predicables 
of force, action, and passion; under that of community, those of presence 
and resistance; under the predicaments of modality those of generation, 
corruption, alteration, and so on. The categories combined 
either with the modis of sensibility or with each other yield a great multitude 
of derivative a priori concepts, to take note of which and, as far as 
possible, completely catalogue would be a useful and not unpleasant but 
here dispensable effort. 


I deliberately spare myself the definitions of these categories in this 
A83 treatise, although I should like to be in possession of them. 13 In the sequel 
I will analyze these concepts to the degree that is sufficient in re-

B 109 lation to the doctrine of method that I am working up. In a system of 
pure reason one could rightly demand these of me; but here they would 
only distract us from the chief point of the investigation by arousing 
doubts and objections that can well be referred to another occasion 
without detracting from our essential aim. In any case, from the little 
that I have here adduced it becomes clear that a complete lexicon with 
all the requisite definitions should be not only possible but even easy to 
produce. The headings already exist; it is merely necessary to fill them 
out, and a systematic topic, such as the present one, will make it easy 
not to miss the place where every concept properly belongs and at the 
same time will make it easy to notice any that is still empty.b 

<§ 11.c 

Subtle considerations about this table of categories could be made, 
which could perhaps have considerable consequences with regard to the 
scientific form of all cognitions of reason. For that this table is uncommonly 
useful, indeed indispensable in the theoretical part of philosophy 
for completely outlining the plan for the whole of a science insofar 
as it rests on a priori concepts, and dividing it mathematically in accordance 
with determinate principles, d is already self-evident from 
the fact that this table completely contains all the elementary concepts

Section III. On the pure concepts of the understanding 

of the understanding, indeed even the form of a system of them in the B I IO 
human understanding, consequently that it gives instruction about all 
the moments, indeed even of their order, of a planned speculative science, 
as I have elsewhere given proof.* Now here are several of these 
remarks. 

The first is that this table, which contains four classes of concepts of 
the understanding, can first be split into two divisions, the first of which 
is concerned with objects of intuition (pure as well as empirical), the 
second of which, however, is directed at the existence of these objects 
(either in relation to each other or to the understanding). 

I will call the first class the mathematical categories, the second, the 
dynamical ones. As one sees, the first class has no correlates, which are 
to be met with only in the second class. Yet this difference must have a 
ground in the nature of the understanding. 

Second remark: that each class always has the same number of categories, 
namely three, which calls for reflection, since otherwise all a 
priori division by means of concepts must be a dichotomy. But here the 
third category always arises from the combination of the first two in its 
class. 

Thus allness (totality) is nothing other than plurality considered as a B I I I 
unity, limitation is nothing other than reality combined with negation, 
community is the causality of a substance in the reciprocal determination 
of others, finally necessity is nothing other than the existence that 
is given by possibility itself. But one should not think that the third category 
is therefore a merely derivative one and not an ancestral concept 
of pure understanding. For the combination of the first and second in 
order to bring forth the third concept requires a special act of the understanding, 
which is not identical with that act performed in the first 
and second. Thus the concept of a number (which belongs to the category 
of allness) is not always possible wherever the concepts of multitude 
and of unity are (e.g., in the representation of the infinite); or 
influence, i.e., how one substance can be the cause of something in another 
substance, is not to be understood immediately by combining the 
concept of a cause and that of a substance. From this it is clear that a 
special act of the understanding is requisite for this; and likewise in the 
other cases. 

Third remark: The agreement of a single category, namely that of 
community, which is to be found under the third title, with the form 
of a disjunctive judgment, which is what corresponds to it in the table B I 12 
of logical functions, is not as obvious as in the other cases. 

In order to be assured of this agreement one must note that in all disjunctive 
judgments the sphere (the multitude of everything that is con


* Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science. B I IO 
215 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. I. Bk I. Ch. I 

tained under it) is represented as a whole divided into parts (the subordinated 
concepts), and, since none of these can be contained under any 
other, they are thought of as coordinated with one another, not subordinated, 
so that they do not determine each other unilaterally, as in 
a series, but reciprocally, as in an aggregate (if one member of the division 
is posited, all the rest are excluded, and vice versa). 

Now a similar connection is thought of in an entirety of things, 
since one is not subordinated,a as effect, under another, as the cause of 
its existence, but is rather coordinatedb with the other simultaneously 
and reciprocally as cause with regard to its determination (e.g., in a 
body, the parts of which reciprocally attract yet also repel each other), 
which is an entirely different kind of connection from that which is to 
be found in the mere relation' of cause to effect (of ground to consequence), 
in which the consequence does not reciprocally determine 
the ground and therefore does not constitute a whole with the latter (as 
the world-creator with the world). The understanding follows the same 

B I I 3 procedure when it represents the divided sphere of a concept as when 
it thinks of a thing as divisible, and just as in the first case the members 
of the division exclude each other and yet are connected in one sphere, 
so in the latter case the parts are represented as ones to which existence 
(as substances) pertains to each exclusively of the others, and which are 
yet connected in one whole. 

§ 12. 


But there is also yet another chapter in the transcendental philosophy 
of the ancients that contains pure concepts of the understanding that, 
although they are not reckoned among the categories, nevertheless according 
to them should also count as a priori concepts of objects, in 
which case, however, they would increase the number of the categories, 
which cannot be. These are expounded in the proposition, so famous 
among the scholastics: quodlibet ens est unum, verum, bonum.d Now although 
the use of this principlee for inferences has turned out to be very 
meager (they have yielded merely tautological propositions), so that in 
modern times it has been customary to grant it a place in metaphysics 
almost solely by courtesy, nevertheless a thought that has sustained itself 
so long, no matter how empty it seems, always deserves an investigation 
of its origin, and justifies the conjecture that it must have its

Section III. On the pure concepts of the understanding 

ground in some rule of the understanding, which, as so often happens, 
has merely been falsely interpreted. These supposedly transcendental 
predicates of things are nothing other than logical requisites and crite-B 114 
ria of all cognition of things in general, and ground it in the categories 
of quantity, namely, the categories of unity, plurality, and totality; yet 
these categories must really have been taken as material, as belonging 
to the possibility of things itself, when in fact they should have been 
used in a merely formal sense, as belonging to the logical requirements 
for every cognition; thus these criteria of thinking were carelessly made 
into properties of things in themselves. In every cognition of an objecta 
there is, namely, unity of the concept, which one can call qualitative 
unity insofar as by that only the unity of the comprehensionb of the 
manifold of cognition is thought, as, say, the unity of the theme in a 
play, a speech, or a fable. Second, truth in respect of the consequences. 
The more true consequences from a given concept, the more indication 
of its objective reality. One could call this the qualitative plurality of 
the marks that belong to a concept as a common ground (not thought 
of in it as a magnitude). Third, finally, perfection, which consists in this 
plurality conversely being traced back to the unity of the concept, and 
agreeing completely with this one and no other one, which one can call 
qualitative completeness (totality). From this it is obvious that these 
logical criteria of the possibility of cognition in general transform the B I I 5 
three categories of magnitude,c in which the unity in the generation of 
the magnituded must be assumed to be completely homogeneous, into 
a principle' with the quality of a cognition for the connection of heterogeneous 
elements of cognition into one consciousness also. Thus 
the criterion of the possibility of a concept (not of its object)! is the definition, 
in which the unity of the concept, the truth of everything that 
may initially be derived from it, and finally the completeness of everything 
that is drawn from it, constitute everything that is necessary for 
the production of the entire concept; or the criterion of a hypothesis 
is also the intelligibility of the ground of explanation or its 
unity (without auxiliary hypotheses), the truth (agreement with itself 
and with experience) of the consequences that are derived from it, and 
finally the completeness of the ground of explanation of these consequences, 
which do not refer us back to anything more or less than was 
already assumed in the hypothesis, and which merely analytically give 
back a posteriori and agree with that which was thought synthetically a

cJurists, when they speak of entitlements and claims, distinguish in a 
legal matter between the questions about what is lawfuld (quid juris) and 

a Paragraph number added in the second edition. In the first edition, the second chapter 
of the "Transcendental Analytic," the "Transcendental Deduction," is divided into three 
main sections, the first of which is in turn subdivided into two subsections. Apart from 
a few minor changes in wording, which will be noted, and the addition of the section 
numbers themselves, the two subsections of the first section are retained in the second 
edition and are identical until the last paragraph of their second subsection, which is replaced 
by three new paragraphs in the second edition. The second and third sections of 
the chapter in the first edition are then replaced by an entirely new second section in 
the second edition, which is broken up into numbered paragraphs § '5 through § 27. 
We will present all of this material in the following sequence: the first section as it appeared 
in both editions, with the last paragraph of the first-edition version followed by 
the last three paragraphs that replaced it in the second edition; the second and third sections 
as they appeared in the first edition; then the second section, consisting of numbered 
parts § '5 through § 27, as it appeared in the second edition.

depend on any object. The representation, however, with which I think, must be given 
to me antecedently in intuition (through imagination). With regard to it I am affected." 
(E XLVI, p. 25; 23=26) 
"It must be proved that if there were no sensible intuition a priori, and if this were 
not the form of sensibility in the subject, with which all appearances must be in accord, 
then:"1. No categories would have significance. 
"2. From mere categories no synthetic a priori propositions at all would be possible."

that which concerns the fact (quid facti), and since they demand proof 
of both, they call the first, that which is to establish the entitlement or 
the legal claim, the deduction.'s We make use of a multitude of empirical 
concepts without objection from anyone, and take ourselves to 
be justified in granting them a sense and a supposed signification even 
without any deduction, because we always have experience ready at 

B II7 hand to prove their objective reality. But there are also concepts that 
have been usurped, such as fortune and fate, which circulate with almost 
universal indulgence, but that are occasionally called upon to establish 
their claim by the question quid juris, and then there is not a 
little embarrassment about their deduction because one can adduce no 
A8S clear legal ground for an entitlement to their use either from experience 
or from reason. 
Among the many concepts, however, that constitute the very mixed 
fabric of human cognition, there are some that are also destineda for 
pure use a priori (completely independently of all experience), and these 
always require a deduction of their entitlement, since proofs from experience 
are not sufficient for the lawfulness of such a use, and yet one 
must know how these concepts can be related to objectsb that they do 
not derive from any experience. I therefore call the explanation of the 
way in which concepts can relate to objects a priori their transcendental 
deduction, and distinguish this from the empirical deduction, 
which shows how a concept is acquired through experience and reflection 
on it, and therefore concerns not the lawfulness but the fact from 

B I 18 
which the possession has arisen. 

Now we already have two sorts of concepts of an entirely different 
kind,c which yet agree with each other in that they both relate to objects 
completely a priori, namely the concepts of space and time, as forms of 
sensibility, and the categories, as concepts of the understanding. To seek 
an empirical deduction of them would be entirely futile work, for what 

A86 is distinctive in their nature is precisely that they are related to their objects 
without having borrowed anything from experience for their representation. 
Thus if a deduction of them is necessary, it must always be 
transcendental. 
Nevertheless, in the case of these concepts, as in the case of all cognition, 
we can search in experience, if not for the principled of their 
possibility, then for the occasional causes of their generation, where the 
impressions of the senses provide the first occasion for opening the en

tire power of cognition to them and for bringing about experience, 
which contains two very heterogeneous elements, namely a matter for 
cognition from the senses and a certain fonn for ordering it from the 
inner source of pure intuiting and thinking, which, on the occasion of 
the former, are first brought into use and bring forth concepts. Such a 
tracing of the first endeavors of our power of cognition to ascend from 
individual perceptions to general concepts is without doubt of great B 119 
utility, and the famous Locke is to be thanked for having first opened 
the way for this. Yet a deduction of the pure a priori concepts can never 
be achieved in this way; it does not lie down this path at all, for in regard 
to their future use, which should be entirely independent of experience, 
an entirely different birth certificate than that of an ancestry 
from experiences must be produced. I will therefore call this attempted 
physiological derivation,16 which cannot properly be called a deduction A 87 
at all because it concerns a quaestio jacti,a the explanation of the possession 
of a pure cognition. It is therefore clear that only a transcendental 
and never an empirical deduction of them can be given, and that in regard 
to pure a priori concepts empirical deductions are nothing but idle 
attempts, which can occupy only those who have not grasped the entirely 
distinctive nature of these cognitions. 

But now even if the sole manner of a possible deduction of pure a priori 
cognition is conceded, namely that which takes the transcendental 
path, it is still not obvious that it is unavoidably necessary. We have 
above traced the concepts of space and time to their sources by means 
of a transcendental deduction, and explained and determined their a pri-B 120 
ori objective validity. Geometry nevertheless follows its secure course 
through strictly a priori cognitions without having to beg philosophy for 
any certification of the pure and lawful pedigree of its fundamental concept 
of space. Yet the use of theb concept in this science concerns only 
the external world of the senses, of which space is the pure form of its 
intuition, and in which therefore all geometrical cognition is immediately 
evident because it is grounded on intuition a priori, and the objects 
are given through the cognition itself a priori in intuition (as far as their A88 
form is concerned). With the pure concepts of the understanding, 
however, there first arises the unavoidable need to search for the transcendental 
deduction not only of them but also of space, for since they 
speak of objects not through predicates of intuition and sensibility but 
through those of pure a priori thinking, they relate to objects generally 
without any conditions of sensibility; and since they are not grounded in 
experience and cannot exhibit any objectC in a priori intuition on which

to ground their synthesis prior to any experience, they not only arouse 
suspicion about the objective validity and limits of their use but also 
make the concept of space ambiguous by inclining us to use it beyond 
B121 the conditions of sensible intuition, on which account a transcendental 
deduction of it was also needed above. Thus the reader must be convinced 
of the unavoidable necessity of such a transcendental deduction 
before he has taken a single step in the field of pure reason; for he would 
otherwise proceed blindly, and after much wandering around would still 
have to return to the ignorance from which he had begun. But he must 
also clearly understand from the outset its inevitable difficulty, so that 
he will not complain of obscurity where the subject-matter itself is 
deeply veiled or become annoyed too soon over the removal of hin


A89 drances, since we must either surrender completely all claims to insights 
of pure reason in its favorite field, namely that beyond the boundaries 
of all possible experience, or else perfect this critical investigation. 

In the case of the concepts of space and time, we were able above to 
make comprehensible with little effort how these, as a priori cognitions, 
must nevertheless necessarily relate to objects, and made possible a synthetic 
cognition of them independent of all experience. For since an object 
can appear to us only by means of such pure forms of sensibility, 
i.e., be an objecta of empirical intuition, space and time are thus pure 


B 122 intuitions that contain a priori the conditions of the possibility of objects 
as appearances, and the synthesis in them has objective validity. 
The categories of the understanding, on the contrary, do not represent 
to us the conditions under which objects are given in intuition at 
all, hence objects can indeed appear to us without necessarily having to 
be related to functions of the understanding, and therefore without the 
understanding containing their a priori conditions.'7 Thus a difficulty is 
revealed here that we did not encounter in the field of sensibility,h. 
namely how subjective conditions of thinking should have objective 
validity, i.e., yield conditions of the possibility of all cognition of 
objects; for appearances can certainly be given in intuition without 
functions of the understanding. I take, e.g., the concept of cause, which 
signifies a particular kind of synthesis, in which given something A 
something entirely different B is posited according to a rule.b It is not 
clear a priori why appearances should contain anything of this sort (one 
cannot adduce experiences for the proof, for the objective validity of 
this a priori concept must be able to be demonstrated), and it is therefore 
a priori doubtful whether such a concept is not perhaps entirely 
empty and finds no object anywhere among the appearances. For that

objects of sensible intuition must accord with the formal conditions of 
sensibility that lie in the mind a priori is clear from the fact that other-B 123 
wise they would not be objects for us; but that they must also accord 
with the conditions that the understanding requires for the synthetic 
unitya of thinking is a conclusion that is not so easily seen.b For appearances 
could after all be so constituted that the understanding would 
not find them in accord with the conditions of its unity, and everything 
would then lie in such confusion that, e.g., in the succession of appearances 
nothing would offer itself that would furnish a rule of synthesis 
and thus correspond to the concept of cause and effect, so that this concept 
would therefore be entirely empty, nugatory, and without significance. 
Appearances would nonetheless offer objects to our intuition, for A91 
intuition by no means requires the functions of thinking. 

If one were to think of escaping from the toils of these investigations 
by saying that experience constantly offers examples of a regularity of 
appearances that give sufficient occasion for abstracting the concept 
of cause from them, and thereby at the same time thought to confirm 
the objective validity of such a concept, then one has not noticed that 
the concept of cause cannot arise in this way at all, but must either be 
grounded in the understanding completely a priori or else be entirely 
surrendered as a mere fantasy of the brain. For this concept always re-B 124 
quires that something A be of such a kind that something else B follows 
from it necessarily and in accordance with an absolutely universal 
rule. Appearances may well offer cases from which a rule is possible in 
accordance with which something usually happens, but never a rule in 
accordance with which the succession is necessary; thus to the synthesis 
of cause and effect there attaches a dignity that can never be expressed 
empirically, namely, that the effect does not merely come along 
with the cause, but is posited through it and follows from it. The strict 
universality of the rule is therefore not any property of empirical rules, 
which cannot acquire anything more through induction than compara-A92 
tive universality, i.e., widespread usefulness. But now the use of the pure 
concepts of the understanding would be entirely altered if one were to 
treat them only as empirical products.

be to grasp it, but I would not be able to explain whence they continuously follow one

make it worse. An implanted necessity would not prove necessity." (E L, pp. 25-6;

"Transition 
to the transcendental deduction of the categories. 

There are only two possible cases in which synthetic representation and 
its objects can come together, necessarily relate to each other, and, as it 
were, meet each other: Either if the object alone makes the representa-
B 12 5 tion possible, or if the representation alone makes the object possible. 
If it is the first, then this relation is only empirical, and the representation 
is never possible a priori. And this is the case with appearance in respect 
of that in it which belongs to sensation. But if it is the second, 
then since representation in itself (for we are not here talking about its 
causality by means of the will) does not produce its object as far as its 
existence is concerned, the representation is still determinant of the 
object a priori if it is possible through it alone to cognize something as 
an object. But there are two conditions under which alone the cognition 
of an object is possible: first, intuition, through which it is given, 
but only as appearance; second, concept, through which an object is 
A93 thought that corresponds to this intuition. It is clear from what has 
been said above, however, that the first condition, namely that under 
which alone objects can be intuited, in fact does lieh in the mind a priori 
as the ground of the form of objects.' All appearances therefore necessarily 
agree with this formal condition of sensibility, because only 
through it can they appear, i.e., be empirically intuited and given. The 
question now is whether a priori concepts do not also precede, as conditions 
under which alone something can be, if not intuited, nevertheless 
thought as object in general, for then all empirical cognition of 
objects is necessarily in accord with such concepts, since without their 
presupposition nothing is possible as objectd of experience. Now, 
however, all experience contains in addition to the intuition of the 
senses, through which something is given, a concept of an object that 
is given in intuition, or appears;IS hence concepts of objects in general 
lie at the ground of all experiential cognition as a priori conditions; consequently 
the objective validity of the categories, as a priori concepts, 
rests on the fact that through them alone is experience possible (as far 
as the form of thinking is concerned). For they then are related necessarily 
and a priori to objects of experience, since only by means of them 
can any object of experience be thought at all.

Section I. On the principles of a transcendental deduction 

The transcendental deduction of all a priori concepts therefore has a A94 
principle toward which the entire investigation must be directed, 
namely this: that they must be recognized as a priori conditions of the 
possibility of experiences (whether of the intuition that is encountered 
in them, or of the thinking). '9 Concepts that supply the objective 
ground of the possibility of experience are necessary just for that reason. 
The unfolding of the experience in which they are encountered, 
however, is not their deduction (but their illustration), since they would 
thereby be only contingent. Without this original relation to possible B 127 
experience, in which all objects of cognition are found, their relation to 
any objectb could not be comprehended at all. 

{[There are, however, three original sources (capacities or faculties of 
the soul), which contain the conditions of the possibility of all experience, 
and cannot themselves be derived from any other faculty of the 
mind, namely sense, imagination, and apperception. On these are 
grounded I) the synopsis of the manifold a priori through sense; 2) the 
synthesis of this manifold through the imagination; finally 3) the unity 
of this synthesis through original apperception. In addition to their 
empirical use, all of these faculties have a transcendental one, which is 
concerned solely with form, and which is possible a priori. We have discussed 
this with regard to the senses in the first part above, however, A95 
we will now attempt to understand the nature of the two other ones.] 

d<The famous Locke, from neglect of this consideration, and because B I2 7 
he encountered pure concepts of the understanding in experience, also 
derived them from this experience, and thus proceeded so inconsistently 
that he thereby dared to make attempts at cognitions that go far 
beyond the boundary of all experience. David Hume recognized that in 
order to be able to do the latter it is necessary that these concepts would 
have to have their origin a priori. But since he could not explain at all 
how it is possible for the understanding to think of concepts that in 
themselves are not combined in the understanding as still necessarily 
combined in the object, and it never occurred to him that perhaps the 
understanding itself, by means of these concepts, could be the originator 
of the experience in which its objects are encountered, he thus, 
driven by necessity, derived them from experience (namely from a subjective 
necessity arisen from frequent association in experience, which 
is subsequently falsely held to be objective, i.e., custom);e however he

subsequently proceeded quite consistently in declaring it to be impossible 
to go beyond the boundary of experience with these concepts and 
the principles that they occasion. The empirical derivation,however, to 

B 128 which both of them resorted, cannot be reconciled with the reality of 
the scientific cognition a priori that we possess, that namely of pure 
mathematics and general natural science, and is therefore refuted by 
the fact.a 

The first of these two famous men opened the gates wide to enthusiasm, 
since reason, once it has authority on its side, will not be kept 
within limits by indeterminate recommendations of moderation; the 
second gave way entirely to skepticism, since he believed himself to 
have discovered in what is generally held to be reason a deception of 
our faculty of cognition. -We are now about to make an attempt to see 
whether we cannot successfully steer human reason between these two 
cliffs, assign its determinate boundaries, and still keep open the entire 
field of its purposive activity. 


I will merely precede this with the explanation of the categories. 
They are concepts of an object in general, by means of which its intuition 
is regarded as determined with regard to one of the logical functions 
for judgments.2o Thus, the function of the categorical judgment 
was that of the relationship of the subject to the predicate, e.g., "All 
bodies are divisible." Yet in regard to the merely logical use of the understanding 
it would remain undetermined which of these two concepts 


B 129 will be given the function of the subject and which will be given that of 
the predicate. For one can also say: "Something divisible is a body." 
Through the category of substance, however, if I bring the concept of 
a body under it, it is determined that its empirical intuition in experience 
must always be considered as subject, never as mere predicate; and 
likewise with all the other categories.>

neither belongs itself within the concept of possible experience nor 
consists of elements of a possible experience. For it would then have no 
content, since no intuition would correspond to it though intuitions in 
general, through which objects can be given to us, constitute the field 
or the entire object of possible experience. An a priori concept that was 
not relateda to the latter would be only the logical form for a concept, 
but not the concept itself through which something would be thought. 
If there are pure a priori concepts, therefore, they can certainly contain 
nothing empirical; they must nevertheless be strictly a priori conditions 
for a possible experience, as that alone on which its objective 
reality can rest. 
Hence if one wants to know how pure concepts of the understanding 
are possible, one must inquire what are the a priori conditions on which A96 
the possibility of experience depends and that ground it even if one abstracts 
from everything empirical in the appearances. A concept that expresses 
this formal and objective condition of experience universally 
and sufficiently would be called a pure concept of the understanding. 
Once I have pure concepts of the understanding, I can also think up objects 
that are perhaps impossible, or that are perhaps possible in themselves 
but cannot be given in any experience since in the connection of 
their concepts something may be omitted that yet necessarily belongs 
to the condition of a possible experience (the concept of a spirit), or 
perhaps pure concepts of the understanding will be extended further 
than experience can grasp (the concept of God). But the elements for 
all a priori cognitions, even for arbitrary and absurd fantasies, cannot indeed 
be borrowed from experience (for then they would not be a priori 
cognitions), but must always contain the pure a priori conditions of a 
possible experience and of an object of it, for otherwise not only would 
nothing at all be thought through them, but also without data they 
would not even be able to arise in thinking at all. 
Now these concepts, which contain a priori the pure thinking in every 
experience, we find in the categories, and it is already a sufficient deduction 
of them and justification of their objective validity if we can A97 
prove that by means of them alone an object can be thought. But since 
in such a thought there is more at work than the single faculty of thinking, 
namely the understanding, and the understanding itself, as a faculty 
of cognition that is to be related to objects,b also requires an elucidation 
of the possibility of this relation, we must first assess not the empirical 
but the transcendental constitution of the subjective sources that comprise 
the a priori foundations for the possibility of experience. 
If every individual representation were entirely foreign to the other, as 

a beziige 
b Objecte 
227 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. I. Bk. I. Ch. II <A> 

it were isolated and separated from it, then there would never arise anything 
like cognition, which is a whole of compared and connected representations. 
If therefore I ascribe a synopsis to sense, because it contains 
a manifold in its intuition, a synthesis must always correspond to this, 
and receptivity can make cognitions possible only if combined with 
spontaneity. This is now the ground of a threefold synthesis, which is 
necessarily found in all cognition: that, namely, of the apprehension of 
the representations, as modifications of the mind in intuition; of the reproduction 
of them in the imagination; and of their recognition in the 
concept.21 Now these direct us toward three subjective sources of cognition, 
which make possible even the understanding and, through the lat


A98 ter, all experience as an empirical product of understanding. 


Preliminary reminder 

The deduction of the categories is connected with so many difficulties, 
and necessitates such deep penetration into the primary grounds of the 
possibility of our cognition in general, that in order to avoid the longwindedness 
of a complete theory and nevertheless not to omit anything 
in such a necessary inquiry, I have found it more advisable to prepare 
than to instruct the reader in the following four numbers, and only then 
to represent the exposition of these elements of the understanding systematically 
in the immediately following third section.a For this reason 
the reader should until then not be deterred by the obscurity that is initially 
unavoidable in a path that is thus far entirely unexplored, but 
which will, as I hope, be completely illuminated in that section. 


1. 

On the synthesis 
of apprehension in the intuition. 


Wherever our representations may arise, whether through the influence 
of external things or as the effect of inner causes, whether they 
have originated a priori or empirically as appearances -as modifications 

A99 of the mind they nevertheless belong to inner sense, and as such all of 
our cognitions are in the end subjected to the formal condition of inner 
sense, namely time, as that in which they must all be ordered, connected, 
and brought into relations. This is a general remark on which 
one must ground everything that follows. 22 
Every intuition contains a manifold in itself, which however would 
not be represented as such if the mind did not distinguish the time in 
the succession of impressions on one another; for as contained in one 

The third section, beginning at AIlS. 

a 

228 


Section II. Grounds of the possibility of experience <A> 

moment no representation can ever be anything other than absolute 
unity. Now in order for unity of intuition to come from this manifold 
(as, say, in the representation of space), it is necessary first to run 
through and then to take together this manifoldness, which action I call 
the synthesis of apprehension, since it is aimed directly at the intuition, 
which to be sure provides a manifold but can never effect this as 
such, and indeed as contained in one representation, without the occurrence 
of such a synthesis. 

Now this synthesis of apprehension must also be exercised a priori, 
i.e., in regard to representations that are not empirical. For without it 
we could have a priori neither the representations of space nor of time, 
since these can be generated only through the synthesis of the manifold A 100 
that sensibility in its original receptivity provides. We therefore have a 
pure synthesis of apprehension. 

2. 


On the synthesis 
of reproduction in the imagination. 
It is, to be sure, a merely empirical law in accordance with which representations 
that have often followed or accompanied one another are 
finally associated with each other and thereby placed in a connection in 
accordance with which, even without the presence of the object, one of 
these representations brings about a transition of the mind to the other 
in accordance with a constant rule. This law of reproduction, however, 
presupposes that the appearances themselves are actually subject to 
such a rule, and that in the manifold of their representations an accompaniment 
or succession takes place according to certain rules; for without 
that our empirical imagination would never get to do anything 
suitable to its capacity,a and would thus remain hidden in the interior of 
the mind, like a dead and to us unknown faculty. If cinnabar were now 
red, now black, now light, now heavy, if a human being were now 
changed into this animal shape, now into that one, if on the longest day 
the land were covered now with fruits, now with ice and snow, then my A 101 
empirical imagination would never even get the opportunity to think of 
heavy cinnabar on the occasion of the representation of the color red; 
or if a certain word were attributed now to this thing, now to that, or if 
one and the same thing were sometimes called this, sometimes that, 
without the governance of a certain rule to which the appearances are 
already subjected in themselves, then no empirical synthesis of reproduction 
could take place. 

There must therefore be something that itself makes possible this re

production of the appearances by being the a priori ground of a necessary 
synthetic unity of them. One soon comes upon this if one recalls 
that appearances are not things in themselves, but rather the mere play 
of our representations, which in the end come down to determinations 
of the inner sense. Now if we can demonstrate that even our purest a 
priori intuitions provide no cognition except insofar as they contain the 
sort of combination of the manifold that makes possible a thoroughgoing 
synthesis of reproduction, then this synthesis of the imagination 
would be grounded even prior to all experience on a priori principles,a 
and one must assume a pure transcendental synthesis of this power, 
which grounds even the possibility of all experience (as that which the 
A I02 reproducibility of the appearances necessarily presupposes). Now it is 
obvious that if I draw a line in thought, or think of the time from one 
noon to the next, or even want to represent a certain number to myself, 
I must necessarily first grasp one of these manifold representations after 
another in my thoughts. But if I were always to lose the preceding representations 
(the first parts of the line, the preceding parts of time, or 
the successively represented units) from my thoughts and not reproduce 
them when I proceed to the following ones, then no whole representation 
and none of the previously mentioned thoughts, not even the 
purest and most fundamental representations of space and time, could 
ever arise. 
The synthesis of apprehension is therefore inseparably combined 
with the synthesis of reproduction. And since the former constitutes the 
transcendental ground of the possibility of all cognition in general (not 
only of empirical cognition, but also of pure a priori cognition), the reproductive 
synthesis of the imagination belongs among the transcendental 
actions of the mind, and with respect to this we will also call this 
faculty the transcendental faculty of the imagination.

A103 On the synthesis 
of recognition in the concept. 


WIthout consciousness that that which we think is the very same as 
what we thought a moment before, all reproduction in the series of representations 
would be in vain. For it would be a new representation in 
our current state, which would not belong at all to the actb through 
which it had been gradually generated, and its manifold would never 
constitute a whole, since it would lack the unity that only consciousness 
can obtain for it. If, in counting, I forget that the units that now hover

before my senses were successively added to each other by me, then I 
would not cognize the generation of the multitudea through this successive 
addition of one to the other, and consequently I would not cognize 
the number; for this concept consists solely in the consciousness of 
this unity of the synthesis. 

The word "concept" itself could already lead us to this remark. For it 
is this one consciousness that unifies the manifold that has been successively 
intuited, and then also reproduced, into one representation. 
This consciousness may often only be weak, so that we connect it with 
the generation of the representation only in the effect, but not in the 
actb itself, i.e., immediately; but regardless of these differences one con-A 104 
sciousness must always be found, even if it lacks conspicuous clarity, and 
without that concepts, and with them cognition of objects, would be entirely 
impossible. 

And here then it is necessary to make understood what is meant by 
the expression "an object of representations." We have said above that 
appearances themselves are nothing but sensible representations, which 
must not be regarded in themselves, in the same way, as objects (outside 
the power of representation). What does one mean, then, if one speaks 
of an object corresponding to and therefore also distinct from the cognition? 
It is easy to see that this object must be thought of only as something 
in general = X, since outside of our cognition we have nothing 
that we could set over against this cognition as corresponding to it. 

We find, however, that our thought of the relation of all cognition to 
its object carries something of necessity with it, since namely the latter 
is regarded as that which is opposed to our cognitions being determined 
at pleasure or arbitrarily rather than being determined a priori, since insofar 
as they are to relate to an object our cognitions must also necessarily 
agree with each other in relation to it, i.e., they must have that A 105 
unity that constitutes the concept of an object.23 

It is clear, however, that since we have to do only with the manifold 
of our representations, and that Xwhich corresponds to them (the object), 
because it should be something distinct from all of our representations, 
is nothing for us, the unity that the object makes necessary can 
be nothing other than the formal unity of the consciousness in the synthesis 
of the manifold of the representations. Hence we say that we cognize 
the object if we have effected synthetic unity in the manifold of 
intuition. But this is impossible if the intuition could not have been produced 
through a function of synthesis in accordance with a rule that 
makes the reproduction of the manifold necessary a priori and a concept 
in which this manifold is united possible. Thus we think of a triangle as 

a Menge 
b Actus 


231 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. 1. Bk. 1. Ch. II <A> 

an object by being conscious of the composition of three straight lines 
in accordance with a rule according to which such an intuition can always 
be exhibited. Now this unity of rule determines every manifold, 
and limits it to conditions that make the unity of apperception possible, 
and the concept of this unity is the representation of the object = X, 
which I think through those predicates of a triangle. 

A 106 All cognition requires a concept, however imperfect or obscure it 
may be; but as far as its form is concerned the latter is always something 
general, and something that serves as a rule. Thus the concept of body 
serves as the rule for our cognition of outer appearances by means of 
the unity of the manifold that is thought through it. However, it can be 
a rule of intuitions only if it represents the necessary reproduction of 
the manifold of given intuitions, hence the synthetic unity in the consciousness 
of them. Thus in the case of the perception of something 
outside of us the concept of body makes necessary the representation of 
extension, and with it that of impenetrability, of shape, etc. 
Every necessity has a transcendental condition as its ground. A transcendental 
ground must therefore be found for the unity of the consciousness 
in the synthesis of the manifold of all our intuitions, hence 
also of the concepts of objectsa in general, consequently also of all objects 
of experience, without which it would be impossible to think of any 
object for our intuitions; for the latter is nothing more than the something 
for which the concept expresses such a necessityb of synthesis. 
Now this original and transcendental condition is nothing other than 


A 107 the transcendental apperception.24 The consciousness of oneself in 
accordance with the determinations of our state in internal perception 
is merely empirical, forever variable; it can provide no standing or abiding 
self in this stream of inner appearances, and is customarily called 
inner sense or empirical apperception. That which should necessar-:­
ily be represented as numerically identical cannot be thought of as such 
through empirical data. There must be a condition that precedes all experience 
and makes the latter itself possible, which should make such a 
transcendental presupposition valid. 


Now no cognitions can occur in us, no connection and unity among 
them, without that unity of consciousness that precedes all data of the 
intuitions, and in relation to which all representation of objects is alone 
possible. This pure, original, unchanging consciousness I will now 
name transcendental apperception. That it deserves this name is already 
obvious from this, that even the purest objective unity, namely 
that of the a priori concepts (space and time) is possible only through 
the relation of the intuitions to it. The numerical unity of this apper

232 



Section II. Grounds of the possibility of experience <A> 

ception therefore grounds all concepts a priori, just as the manifoldness 
of space and time grounds the intuitions of sensibility. 

Just this transcendental unity of apperception, however, makes out of A ra8 
all possible appearances that can ever come together in one experience 
a connection of all of these representations in accordance with laws.25 
For this unity of consciousness would be impossible if in the cognition 
of the manifold the mind could not become conscious of the identity of 
the function by means of which this manifold is synthetically combined 
into one cognition. Thus the original and necessary consciousness of 
the identity of oneself is at the same time a consciousness of an equally 
necessary unity of the synthesis of all appearances in accordance with 
concepts, i.e., in accordance with rules that not only make them necessarily 
reproducible, but also thereby determine an object for their intuition, 
i.e., the concept of something in which they are necessarily 
connected; for the mind could not possibly think of the identity of itself 
in the manifoldness of its representations, and indeed think this a 
priori, if it did not have before its eyes the identity of its action, which 
subjects all synthesis of apprehension (which is empirical) to a transcendental 
unity, and first makes possible their connection in accordance 
with a priori rules. Further, we are now also able to determine our 
concepts of an object in general more correctly. All representations, as 
representations, have their object, and can themselves be objects of 
other representations in turn. Appearances are the only objects that can 
be given to us immediately, and that in them which is immediately re-A 109 
lated to the object is called However, these appearances are 
not things in themselves, but themselves only representations, which in 
turn have their object, which therefore cannot be further intuited by us, 
and that may therefore be called the non-empirical, i.e., transcendental 
object = X26 

The pure concept of this transcendental object (which in all of our 
cognitions is really always one and the same = X) is that which in all of 
our empirical concepts in general can provide relation to an object, i.e., 
objective reality. Now this concept cannot contain any determinate intuition 
at all, and therefore concerns nothing but that unity which 
must be encountered in a manifold of cognition insofar as it stands in 
relation to an object. This relation, however, is nothing other than the 
necessary unity of consciousness, thus also of the synthesis of the manifold 
through a common function of the mind for combining it in one 
representation. Now since this unity must be regarded as necessary a 
priori (since the cognition would otherwise be without an object), the 
relation to a transcendental object, i.e., the objective reality of our empirical 
cognition, rests on the transcendental law that all appearances, A I 10 
insofar as objects are to be given to us through them, must stand under 
a priori rules of their synthetic unity, in accordance with which their re


233 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. I. Bk. I. Ch. II <A> 

lationa in empirical intuition is alone possible, i.e., that in experience 
they must stand under conditions of the necessary unity of apperception 
just as in mere intuition they must stand under the formal conditions 
of space and time; indeed, it is through those conditions that 
every cognition is first made possible. 

4· 

Provisional explanation of the possibility ofthe 
categories asa priori cognitions. 


There is only one experience, in which all perceptions are represented 
as in thoroughgoing and lawlike connection, just as there is only one 
space and time, in which all forms of appearance and all relationb of 
being or non-being take place. If one speaks of different experiences, 
they are only so many perceptions insofar as they belong to one and the 
same universal experience. The thoroughgoing and synthetic unity of 
perceptions is precisely what constitutes the form of experience, and it 
is nothing other than the synthetic unity of the appearances in accordance 
with concepts. 
A I I I Unity of synthesis in accordance with empirical concepts would be 
entirely contingent, and, were it not grounded on a transcendental 
ground of unity, it would be possible for a swarm of appearances to fill 
up our soul without experience ever being able to arise from it. But in 
that case all relation of cognition to objects would also disappear, since 
the appearances would lack connection in accordance with universal 
and necessary laws, and would thus be intuition without thought, but 
never cognition, and would therefore be as good as nothing for us. 

The a priori conditions of a possible experience in general are at the 
same time conditions of the possibility of the objects of experience, 
Now I assert that the categories that have just been adduced are nothing 
other than the conditions of thinking in a possible experience, 
just as space and time contain the conditions of the intuition for the 
very same thing. They are therefore also fundamental concepts for 
thinking objectsC in general for the appearances, and they therefore 
have a priori objective validity, which was just what we really wanted to 
know. 

However, the possibility, indeed even the necessity of these categories 
rests on the relation that the entire sensibility, and with it also all 
possible appearances, have to the original apperception, in which everything 
is necessarily in agreement with the conditions of the thorough

Section II. Grounds of the possibility of experience <A> 

going unity of self-consciousness, i.e., must stand under universal func-A I 12 
tions of synthesis, namely of the synthesis in accordance with concepts, 
as that in which alone apperception can demonstrate a priori its thoroughgoing 
and necessary identity. Thus the concept of a cause is nothing 
other than a synthesis (of that which follows in the temporal series 
with other appearances) in accordance with concepts; and without 
that sort of unity, which has its rule a priori, and which subjects the appearances 
to itself, thoroughgoing and universal, hence necessary unity 
of consciousness would not be encountered in the manifold perceptions. 
But these would then belong to no experience, and would consequently 
be without an object,a and would be nothing but a blind play of 
representations, i.e., less than a dream. 

All attempts to derive these pure concepts of the understanding from 
experience and to ascribe to them a merely empirical origin are therefore 
entirely vain and futile. I will not mention that, e.g., the concept of 
a cause brings the trait of necessity with it, which no experience at all 
can yield, for experience teaches us that one appearance customarily follows 
another, but not that it must necessarily follow that, nor that an inference 
from a condition to its consequence can be made a priori and 
entirely universally. But that empirical rule of association, which one 
must assume throughout if one says that everything in the series of occurrences 
stands under rules according to which nothing happens that A I I 3 
is not preceded by something upon which it always follows -on what, I 
ask, does this, as a law of nature, rest, and how is this association even 
possible? The ground of the possibility of the association of the manifold, 
insofar as it lies in the object,b is called the affinity of the manifold. 
I ask, therefore, how do you make the thoroughgoing affinity of the appearances 
(by means of which they stand under constant laws and must 
belong under them) comprehensible to yourselves? 

On my principles it is easily comprehensible. All possible appearances 
belong, as representations, to the whole possible self-consciousness. But 
from this, as a transcendental representation, numerical identity is inseparable, 
and certain a priori, because nothing can come into cognition except 
by means of this original apperception. Now since this identity must 
necessarily enter into the synthesis of all the manifold of appearances insofar 
as they are to become empirical cognition, the appearances are thus 
subject to a priori conditions with which their synthesis (of apprehension) 
must be in thoroughgoing accord. Now, however, the representation of 
a universal condition in accordance with which a certain manifold (of 
whatever kind) can be posited is called a rule, and, if it must be so 
posited, a law. All appearances therefore stand in a thoroughgoing con

AII4 nection according to necessary laws, and hence in a transcendental 
affinity, of which the empirical affinity is the mere consequence. 
That nature should direct itself according to our subjective ground of 
apperception, indeed in regard to its lawfulness even depend on this, 
may well sound quite contradictory and strange. But if one considers 
that this nature is nothing in itself but a sum of appearances, hence not 
a thing in itself but merely a multitude of representations of the mind, 
then one will not be astonished to see that unity on account of which 
alone it can be called object a of all possible experience, i.e., nature, 
solely in the radical faculty of all our cognition, namely, transcendental 
apperception; and for that very reason we can cognize this unity a priori, 
hence also as necessary, which we would certainly have to abandon 
if it were given in itself independently of the primary sources of our 
thinking. For then I would not know whence we should obtain the synthetic 
propositions of such a universal unity of nature, since in this case 
one would have to borrow them from the objects of nature itself. But 
since this could happen only empirically, from that nothing but merely 
contingent unity could be drawn, which would fall far short of the necessary 
connection that one has in mind when one speaks of nature. 

Of the Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding 
Third Section 

On the relationb of the understanding to objects 
in general and the 
possibility of cognizing these a priori. 

What we have expounded separately and individually in the previous 
section we will now represent as unified and in connection. The possibility 
of an experience in general and cognition of its objects rest on 
three subjective sources of cognition: sense, imagination, and apperception; 
each of these can be considered empirically, namely in application 
to given appearances, but they are also elements or foundations 
apriori that make this empirical use itself possible. Sense represents the 
appearances empirically in perception, the imagination in association 
(and reproduction), and apperception in the empirical consciousness 
of the identity of these reproductive representations with the appearances 
through which they were given, hence in recognition. 

But pure intuition (with regard to it as representation, time, the form 
of inner intuition) grounds the totality of perception a priori; the pure 
AII6 synthesis of the imagination grounds association a priori; and pure ap

Section III. On the relation of understanding to objects <A> 

perception, i.e., the thoroughgoing identity of oneself in all possible 
representations, grounds empirical consciousness a priori.27 

Now if we wish to follow the inner ground of this connection of representations 
up to that point in which they must all come together in 
order first to obtain unity of cognition for a possible experience, then 
we must begin with pure apperception. All intuitions are nothing for us 
and do not in the least concern us if they cannot be taken up into consciousness, 
whether they influence it directly or indirectly, and through 
this alone is cognition possible.28 We are conscious a priori ofhthe thoroughgoing 
identity of ourselves with regard to all representations that 
can ever belong to our cognition, as a necessary condition of the possibility 
of all representations (since the latter represent something in me 
only insofar as they belong with all the others to one consciousness, 
hence they must at least be capable of being connected in it). This principle 
holds a priori, and can be called the transcendental principleb 
of the unity of all the manifold of our representations (thus also in intuition). 
Now the unity of the manifold in a subject is synthetic; pure 
apperception therefore yields a principle of the synthetic unity of the A I 17 
manifold in all possible intuition.* 

This synthetic unity, however, presupposes a synthesis, or includes it, A I 18 
and if the former is to be necessary a priori then the latter must also be 

* One should attend carefully to this proposition, which is of great importance. A I I 7 
All representations have a necessary relation to a possible empirical consciousness: 
for if they did not have this, and if it were entirely impossible to become 
conscious of them, that would be as much as to say that they did not exist 
at all. All empirical consciousness, however, has a necessary relation to a transcendental 
consciousness (preceding all particular experience), namely the consciousness 
of myself, as original apperception. It is therefore absolutely 
necessary that in my cognition all consciousness belong to one consciousness 
(of myself). Now here is a synthetic unity of the manifold (of consciousness) 
that is cognized a priori, and that yields the ground for synthetic apriori propositions 
concerning pure thinking in exactly the same way that space and time 
yield such propositions concerning the form of mere intuition. The synthetic 
proposition that every different empirical consciousness must be combined 
into a single self-consciousness is the absolutely first and synthetic principle of 
our thinking in general. But it should not go unnoticed that the mere representation 
I in relation to all others (the collective unity of which it makes possible) 
is the transcendental consciousness. Now it does not matter here 
whether this representation be clear (empirical consciousness) or obscure, even 
whether it be actual; but the possibility of the logical form of all cognition necessarily 
rests on the relationship to this apperception as a faculty.

a synthesis a priori. Thus the transcendental unity of apperception is related 
to the pure synthesis of the imagination, as an a priori condition of 
the possibility of all composition of the manifold in a cognition. But 
only the productive synthesis of the imagination can take place a priori; 
for the reproductive synthesis rests on conditions of experience. 
The principlea of the necessary unity of the pure (productive) synthesis 
of the imagination prior to apperception is thus the ground of the possibility 
of all cognition, especially that of experience.29 

Now we call the synthesis of the manifold in imagination transcendental 
if, without distinction of the intuitions, it concerns nothing but 
the connection of the manifold a priori, and the unity of this synthesis 
is called transcendental if it is represented as necessary a priori in relation 
to the original unity of apperception. Now since this latter is the 
ground of the possibility of all cognitions, the transcendental unity of 

the synthesis of the imagination is the pure form of all possible cognition, 
through which, therefore, all objects of possible experience must 
be represented a priori. 

AII9 The unity of apperception in relation to the synthesis of the 
imagination is the understanding, and this very same unity, in relation 
to the transcendental synthesis of the imagination, is the pure understanding. 
In the understanding there are therefore pure a priori 
cognitions that contain the necessary unity of the pure synthesis of the 
imagination in regard to all possible appearances.30 These, however, are 
the categories, i.e., pure concepts of the understanding; consequently 
the empirical power of cognition of human beings necessarily contains 
an understanding, which is related to all objects of the senses, though 
only by means of intuition, and to their synthesis by means of imagination, 
under which, therefore, all appearances as data for a possible experience 
stand. Now since this relation of appearances to possible 
experience is likewise necessary (since without it we could not obtain 
any cognition at all through them, and they would thus not concern us 
at all), it follows that the pure understanding, by means of the categories, 
is a formal and synthetic principleb of all experiences, and that 
appearances have a necessary relation to the understanding. 
Now we will set the necessary connection of the understanding with 
the appearances by means of the categories before our eyes by beginning 
from beneath, namely with what is empirical. The first thing that 


A I 20 is given to us is appearance, which, if it is combined with consciousness, 
is called perception (without the relatione to an at least possible consciousness 
appearance could never become an object of cognition for us,

Section III. On the relation of understanding to objects <A> 

and would therefore be nothing for us, and since it has no objective reality 
in itself and exists only in cognition it would be nothing at all). But 
since every appearance contains a manifold, thus different perceptions 
by themselves are encountered dispersed and separate in the mind, a 
combination of them, which they cannot have in sense itself, is therefore 
necessary. There is thus an active faculty of the synthesis of this manifold 
in us, which we call imagination, and whose action exercised immediately 
upon perceptions I call apprehension.* For the imagination is 
to bring the manifold of intuition into an image;a it must therefore antecedently 
take up the impressions into its activity, i.e., apprehend them. 

It is, however, clear that even this apprehension of the manifold alone A I 2 I 
would bring forth no image and no connection of the impressions were 
there not a subjective ground for calling back a perception, from which 
the mind has passed on to another, to the succeeding ones, and thus for 
exhibiting entire series of perceptions, i.e., a reproductive faculty of 
imagination, which is then also merely empirical. 

Since, however, if representations reproduced one another without 
distinction, just as they fell together, there would in turn be no determinate 
connection but merely unruly heaps of them, and no cognition 
at all would arise; their reproduction must thus have a rule in accordance 
with which a representation enters into combination in the imagination 
with one representation rather than with any others. This 
subjective and empirical ground of reproduction in accordance with 
rules is called the association of representations. 

But now if this unity of association did not also have an objective 
ground, so that it would be impossible for appearances to be apprehended 
by the imagination otherwise than under the condition of a possible 
synthetic unity of this apprehension, then it would also be entirely 
contingent whether appearances fit into a connection of human cognitions. 
For even though we had the faculty for associating perceptions, it 
would still remain in itself entirely undetermined and contingent AI22 
whether they were also associable; and in case they were not, a multitude 
of perceptions and even an entire sensibility would be possible in 
which much empirical consciousness would be encountered in my 
mind, but separated, and without belonging to one consciousness of 

* No psychologist has yet thought that the imagination is a necessary ingredi-AI20 
ent of perception itself. This is so partly because this faculty has been limited 
to reproduction, and partly because it has been believed that the senses do not 
merely afford us impressions but also put them together, and produce images 
of objects, for which without doubt something more than the receptivity of 
impressions is required, namely a function of the synthesis of them.

myself, which, however, is impossible. For only because I ascribe all 
perceptions to one consciousness (of original apperception) can I say of 
all perceptions that I am conscious of them. There must therefore be an 
objective ground, i.e., one that can be understood a priori to all empiricalhlaws 
of the imagination, on which rests the possibility, indeed even 
the necessity of a law extending through all appearances, a law, namely, 
for regarding them throughout as data of sense that are associable in 
themselves and subject to universal laws of a thoroughgoing connection 
in reproduction. I call this objective ground of all association of appearances 
their affinity. But we can never encounter this anywhere ex



cept in the principle of the unity of apperception with regard to all 
cognitions that are to belong to me. In accordance with this principle 
all appearances whatever must come into the mind or be apprehended 
in such a way that they are in agreement with the unity of apperception, 
which would be impossible without synthetic unity in their connection, 
which is thus also objectively necessary. 

AI23 The objective unity of all (empirical) consciousness in one consciousness 
(of original apperception) is thus the necessary condition 
even of all possible perception, and the affinity of all appearances (near 
or remote) is a necessary consequence of a synthesis in the imagination 
that is grounded a priori on rules. 
The imagination is therefore also a faculty of a synthesis a priori, on 


account of which we give it the name of productive imagination, and, 
insofar as its aim in regard to all the manifold of appearance is nothing 
further than the necessary unity in their synthesis, this can be called the 
transcendental function of the imagination. It is therefore certainly 
strange, yet from what has been said thus far obvious, that it is only by 
means of this transcendental function of the imagination that even the 
affinity of appearances, and with it the association and through the latter 
finally reproduction in accordance with laws, and consequently experience 
itself, become possible; for without them no concepts of 
objects at all would converge into an experience. 

For the standing and lasting I (of pure apperception) constitutes the 
correlate of all of our representations, so far as it is merely possible to 
become conscious of them, and all consciousness belongs to an all-embracing 
pure apperception just as all sensible intuition as representation 
belongs to a pure inner intuition, namely that of time. It is this apperception 
that must be added to the pure imagination in order to make its 
function intellectual. For in itself the synthesis of the imagination, although 
exercised a priori, is nevertheless always sensible, for it combines 
the manifold only as it appears in intuition, e.g., the shape of a triangle. 
Through the relationa of the manifold to the unity of apperception, 

a Verhiiltnis 


240 



Section III. On the relation of understanding to objects <A> 

however, concepts that belong to the understanding can come about, but 
only by means of the imagination in relation to the sensible intuition. 

We therefore have a pure imagination, as a fundamental faculty of the 
human soul, that grounds all cognition a priori. By its means we bring 
into combination the manifold of intuition on the one side and the condition 
of the necessary unity of apperception on the other. Both extremes, 
namely sensibility and understanding, must necessarily be connected 
by means of this transcendental function of the imagination, 
since otherwise the former would to be sure yield appearances but no 
objects of an empirical cognition, hence there would be no experience. 
Actual experience, which consists in the apprehension, the association 
(the reproduction), and finally the recognition of the appearances, contains 
in the last and highest (of the merely empirical elements of expe-A 125 
rience) concepts that make possible the formal unity of experience and 
with it all objective validity (truth) of empirical cognition. These 
grounds of the recognition of the manifold, so far as they concern 
merely the form of an experience in general, are now those categories. 
On them is grounded, therefore, all formal unity in the synthesis 
of the imagination, and by means of the latter also all of its empirical 
use (in recognition, reproduction, association, and apprehension) down 
to the appearances, since the latter belong to our consciousness at all 
and hence to ourselves only by means of these elements of cognition. 

Thus we ourselves bring into the appearances that order and regularity 
in them that we call nature,JI and moreover we would not be able 
to find it there if we, or the nature of our mind, had not originally put 
it there. For this unity of nature should be a necessary, i.e., a priori certain 
unity of the connection of appearances. But how should we be able 
to establish a synthetic unity a priori if subjective grounds of such a 
unity were not contained a priori among the original sources of cognition 
in our mind, and if these subjective conditions were not at the same 
time objectively valid, being the grounds of the possibility of cognizing A I 26 
any objecta in experience at all?b

"That the laws of nature really have their origin in the understanding, and are just 
as little to be encountered outside it as space and time are, is already proved by the in 
any case already acknowledged assertion that we cognize them a priori and as necessary; 
for if, on the contrary, they had to be borrowed from outside, we could only cognize 
them as contingent. But then what sort oflaws are those? No greater and no less than 
is necessary in order to bring appearances into a general connection with one consciousness, 
only in order to cognize objects as such -for that is the form of their intuition 
and at the same time the condition of their unity in apperception given, and given 
a priori." (E LI, pp. 26-7; 23:26-7)

Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. I. Bk. I. Ch. II <A> 

We have above explained the understanding in various ways -through 
a spontaneity of cognition (in contrast to the receptivity of the sensibility), 
through a faculty for thinking, or a faculty of concepts, or also of 
judgments -which explanations, if one looks at them properly, come 
down to the same thing. Now we can characterize it as the faculty of 
rules. This designation is more fruitful, and comes closer to its essence. 
Sensibility gives us forms (of intuition), but the understanding gives us 
rules. It is always busy poring through the appearances with the aim of 
finding some sort of rule in them. Rules, so far as they are objectivea (and 
thus necessarily pertain to the cognition of objects) are called laws. 
Although we learn many laws through experience, these are only particular 
determinations of yet higher laws, the highest of which (under 
which all others stand) come from the understanding itself a priori, and 
are not borrowed from experience, but rather must provide the appearances 
with their lawfulness and by that very means make experience possible. 
The understanding is thus not merely a faculty for making rules 
through the comparison of the appearances; it is itself the legislation for 
nature, i.e., without understanding there would not be any nature at all, 

i.e. synthetic unity of the manifold of appearances in accordance with 
rules; for appearances, as such, cannot occur outside us, but exist only in 
our sensibility. The latter, however, as the object of cognition in an experience, 
with everything it may contain, is possible only in the unity of 
apperception. The unity of apperception, however, is the transcendental 
ground of the necessary lawfulness of all appearances in an experience. 
This very same unity of apperception with regard to a manifold of representations 
(that namely of determining it out of a single one) is the 
rule, and the faculty of these rules is the understanding. All appearances 
as possible experiences, therefore, lie a priori in the understanding, and 
receive their formal possibility from it, just as they lie in the sensibility 
as mere intuitions, and are only possible through the latter as far as their 
form is concerned. 
Thus as exaggerated and contradictory as it may sound to say that the 
understanding is itself the source of the laws of nature, and thus of the 
formal unity of nature, such an assertion is nevertheless correct and appropriate 
to the object, namely experience. To be sure, empirical laws, 
as such, can by no means derive their origin from the pure understanding, 
just as the immeasurable manifoldness of the appearances cannot 
be adequately conceived through the pure form of sensible intuition. 

AI28 But all empirical laws are only particular determinations of the pure 

edition deduction, from which he infers that Kant in fact very early gave up hope of improving 
the deduction by minor changes.

laws of the understanding, under which and in accordance with whose 
norm they are first possible, and the appearances assume a lawful form, 
just as, regardless of the variety of their empirical form, all appearances 
must nevertheless always be in accord with the pure form of sensibility. 

The pure understanding is thus in the categories the law of the synthetic 
unity of all appearances, and thereby first and originally makes 
experience possible as far as its form is concerned. But we did not have 
to accomplish more in the transcendental deduction of the categories 
than to make comprehensible this relationa of the understanding to sensibility 
and by means of the latter to all objects of experience, hence to 
make comprehensible the objective validity of its pure a priori concepts, 
and thereby determine their origin and truth. 

Summary representation 
of the correctness and unique possibility of this 
deduction 
of the pure concepts of the understanding. 

If the objects with which our cognition has to do were things in them


selves, then we would not be able to have any a priori concepts of them 

at all. For whence should we obtain them? If we take them from the ob


jectb (without even investigating here how the latter could become 

known to us), then our concepts would be merely empirical and not a AI29 
priori concepts. If we take them from ourselves, then that which is 
merely in us cannot determine the constitution of an object distinct 

from our representations, i.e., be a ground why there should be a thing 
that corresponds to something we have in our thoughts, and why all 
this representation should not instead be empty. But if, on the contrary, 
we have to do everywhere only with appearances, then it is not only 
possible but also necessary that certain a priori concepts precede the 
empirical cognition of objects. For as appearances they constitute an 
object that is merely in us, since a mere modification of our sensibility 
is not to be encountered outside us at all. Now even this representation 
-that all these appearances and thus all objects with which we can 
occupy ourselves are all in me, i.e., determinations of my identical 
self-expresses a thoroughgoing unity of them in one and the same apperception 
as necessary. The form of all cognition of objects (through 
which the manifold is thought as belonging to one object),c however, 
also consists in this unity of possible consciousness. Thus the way in 
which the manifold of sensible representation (intuition) belongs to a

243

consciousness precedes all cognition of the object, as its intellectual 

A I 30 form, and itself constitutes an a priori formal cognition of all objects 
in general, insofar as they are thought (categories). Their synthesis 
through the pure imagination, the unity of all representations in relation 
to original apperception, precede all empirical cognition. Pure 
concepts of the understanding are therefore possible, indeed necessary 
a priori in relation to experience, only because our cognition has to do 
with nothing but appearances, whose possibility lies in ourselves, 
whose connection and unity (in the representation of an object) is encountered 
merely in us, and thus must precede all experience and first 
make it possible as far as its form is concerned. And from this ground, 
the only possible one among all, our deduction of the categories has 
been conducted.

The manifold of representations can be given in an intuition that is 
merely sensible, i.e., nothing but receptivity, and the form of this intuition 
can lie a priori in our faculty of representation without being anything 
other than the way in which the subject is affected. Yet the 
combination (conjunctio) of a manifold in general can never come to us 
through the senses, and therefore cannot already be contained in the 
pure form of sensible intuition; for it is an actb of the spontaneity of the B 130 
power of representation, and, since one must call the latter understanding, 
in distinction from sensibility, all combination, whether we are 
conscious of it or not, whether it is a combination of the manifold of intuition 
or of several concepts, and in the first case either of sensible or 
non-sensible intuition, is an action of the understanding, which we 
would designate with the general title synthesis in order at the same 
time to draw attention to the fact that we can represent nothing as combined 
in the objectC without having previously combined it ourselves, 
and that among all representations combination is the only one that is 
not given through objectsd but can be executed only by the subject itself, 
since it is an acte of its self-activity. One can here easily see that this 
action must originally be unitary! and equally valid for all combination,

and that the dissolution (analysis) that seems to be its opposite, in fact 
always presupposes it; for where the understanding has not previously 
combined anything, neither can it dissolve anything, for only through 
it can something have been given to the power of representation as 
combined. 

But in addition to the concept of the manifold and of its synthesis, the 

concept of combination also carries with it the concept of the unity of 

the manifold. Combination is the representation of the synthetic unity 

B I3 1 of the manifold. * The representation of this unity cannot, therefore, 
arise from the combination; rather, by being added to the representation 
of the manifold, it first makes the concept of combination possible.
33 This unity, which precedes all concepts of combination a priori, is 
not the former category of unity (§ 10); for all categories are grounded 
on logical functions in judgments, but in these combination, thus the 
unity of given concepts, is already thought. The category therefore already 
presupposes combination. We must therefore seek this unity (as 
qualitative, § 12) someplace higher, namely in that which itself contains 
the ground of the unity of different concepts in judgments, and hence 
of the possibility of the understanding, even in its logical use. 

§ 16. 

On the original-synthetic unity of 
apperception. 

The I think must be able to accompany all my representations; for 

B 132 otherwise something would be represented in me that could not be 
thought at all, which is as much as to say that the representation would 
either be impossible or else at least would be nothing for me. That representation 
that can be given prior to all thinking is called intuition. 
Thus all manifold of intuition has a necessary relation to the I think in 
the same subject in which this manifold is to be encountered. But this 
representation is an acta of spontaneity, i.e., it cannot be regarded as 
belonging to sensibility. I call it the pure apperception, in order to distinguish 
it from the empirical one, or also the original apperception, 
since it is that self-consciousness which, because it produces the representation 
I think, which must be able to accompany all others and 

B 131 * Whether the representations themselves are identical, and whether therefore 
one could be thought through the other analytically, does not come into consideration 
here. The consciousness of the one, as far as the manifold is concerned, 
is still always to be distinguished from the consciousness of the other, 
and it is only the synthesis of this (possible) consciousness that is at issue here. 

a Actus 


246 


Section II. Trans. deduction of pure concepts of understanding <B> 

which in all consciousness is one and the same, cannot be accompanied 
by any further representation. I also call its unity the transcendental 
unity of self-consciousness in order to designate the possibility of a priori 
cognition from it. For the manifold representations that are given in 
a certain intuition would not all together be my representations if they 
did not all together belong to a self-consciousness; i.e., as my representations 
(even if I am not conscious of them as such) they must yet necessarily 
be in accord with the condition under which alone they can 
stand together in a universal self-consciousness, because otherwise they 
would not throughout belong to me. From this original combination B 133 
much may be inferred. 

Namely, this thoroughgoing identity of the apperception of a manifold 
given in intuition contains a synthesis of the representations, and is 
possible only through the consciousness of this synthesis. For the empirical 
consciousness that accompanies different representations is by 
itself and without relation to the identity of the subject. The 
latter therefore does not yet come about by my accompanying 
each representation with consciousness, but rather by my adding one 
representation to the other and being conscious of their synthesis. 
Therefore it is only because I can combine a manifold of given representations 
in one consciousness that it is possible for me to represent 
the identity of the consciousness in these representations itself, i.e., 
the analytical unity of apperception is only possible under the presupposition 
of some synthetic one.*,34 The thought that these representa-B 134 
tions given in intuition all together belong to me means, accordingly, 
the same as that I unite them in a self-consciousness, or at least can 
unite them therein, and although it is itself not yet the consciousness of 
the synthesis of the representations, it still presupposes the possibility 
of the latter, i.e., only because I can comprehend their manifold in a 
consciousness do I call them all together my representations; for otherwise 
I would have as multicolored, diverse a self as I have representa


*The analytical unity of consciousness pertains to all common concepts as B 133 
such, e.g., if I think of red in general, I thereby represent to myself a feature 
that (as a mark) can be encountered in anything, or that can be combined with 
other representations; therefore only by means of an antecedently conceived 
possible synthetic unity can I represent to myself the analytical unity. A representation 
that is to be thought of as common to several must be regarded 
as belonging to those that in addition to it also have something different in B 134 
themselves; consequently they must antecedently be conceived in synthetic 
unity with other (even if only possible representations) before I can think of 
the analytical unity of consciousness in it that makes it into a conceptus communis. 
And thus the synthetic unity of apperception is the highest point to which 
one must affix all use of the understanding, even the whole of logic and, after 
it, transcendental philosophy; indeed this faculty is the understanding itself. 
247 


:B 136 :B 136

tions of which I am conscious. Synthetic unity of the manifold of intuitions, 
as given a priori, is thus the ground of the identity of apperception 
itself, which precedes a priori all my determinate thinking. 
Combination does not lie in the objects, however, and cannot as it were 
be borrowed from them through perception and by that means first 

B 135 taken up into the understanding, but is rather only an operation of the 
understanding, which is itself nothing further than the faculty of combininga 
priori and bringing the manifold of given representations under 
unity of apperception, which principle is the supreme one in the whole 
of human cognition.35 


Now this principle of the necessary unity of apperception is, to be 
sure, itself identical, thus an analytical proposition, yet it declares as 
necessary a synthesis of the manifold given in an intuition, without 
which that thoroughgoing identity of self-consciousness could not be 
thought. For through the I, as a simple representation, nothing manifold 
is given; it can only be given in the intuition, which is distinct from 
it, and thought through combination in a consciousness. An understanding, 
in which through self-consciousness all of the manifold would 
at the same time be given, would intuit; ours can only think and must 
seek the intuition in the senses. I am therefore conscious of the identical 
self in regard to the manifold of the representations that are given 
to me in an intuition because I call them all together my representations, 
which constitute one. But that is as much as to say that I am conscious 
a priori of their necessary synthesis, which is called the original 
synthetic unity of apperception, under which all representations given 
to me stand, but under which they must also be brought by means of a 
synthesis. 

§ 17· 

The principle of the synthetic unity of apperception 
is the supreme principle of all use of the understanding. 

The supreme principle of the possibility of all intuition in relation to 
sensibility was, according to the Transcendental Aesthetic, that all the 
manifold of sensibility stand under the formal conditions of space and 
time. The supreme principle of all intuition in relation to the understanding 
is that all the manifold of intuition stand under conditions of 
the original synthetic unity of apperception.*,36 All the manifold repre


* Space and time and all their parts are intuitions, thus individual representations 
along with the manifold that they contain in themselves (see the 
Transcendental Aesthetic), thus they are not mere concepts by means of which 
the same consciousness is contained in many representations, but rather are 
many representations that are contained in one and in the consciousness of it; 
they are thus found to be composite, and consequently the unity of con248 



Section II. Trans. deduction of pure concepts of understanding <B> 

sentations of intuition stand under the first principle insofar as they are 
given to us, and under the second insofar as they must be capable of 
being combined in one consciousness; for without that nothing could B 137 
be thought or cognized through them, since the given representations 
would not have in common the acta of apperception, I think, and 
thereby would not be grasped together in a self-consciousness. 

Understanding is, generally speaking, the faculty of cognitions. 
These consist in the determinate relation of given representations to an 
object." An object,c however, is that in the concept of which the manifold 
of a given intuition is united.37 Now, however, all unification of 
representations requires unity of consciousness in the synthesis of 
them. Consequently the unity of consciousness is that which alone constitutes 
the relation of representations to an object, thus their objective 
validity, and consequently is that which makes them into cognitions and 
on which even the possibility of the understanding rests. 

The first pure cognition of the understanding, therefore, on which 
the whole of the rest of its use is grounded, and that is at the same time 
also entirely independent from all conditions of sensible intuition, is the 
principle of the original synthetic unity of apperception. Thus the 
mere form of outer sensible intuition, space, is not yet cognition at all; 
it only gives the manifold of intuition a priori for a possible cognition. 
But in order to cognize something in space, e.g., a line, I must draw it, 
and thus synthetically bring about a determinate combination of the B 138 
given manifold, so that the unity of this action is at the same time the 
unity of consciousness (in the concept of a line), and thereby is an objectd 
(a determinate space) first cognized. The synthetic unity of consciousness 
is therefore an objective condition of all cognition, not 
merely something I myself need in order to cognize an objecte but 
rather something under which every intuition must stand in order to 
become an objectf for me, since in any other way, and without this 
synthesis, the manifold would not be united in one consciousness. 

This last proposition is, as we said, itself analytic, although, to be 
sure, it makes synthetic unity into the condition of all thinking; for it 
says nothing more than that all my representations in any given intuition 
must stand under the condition under which alone I can ascribe 

sciousness, as synthetic and yet as original, is to be found in them. This singularity 
of theirs is important in its application (see § 25).

them to the identical self as my representations, and thus can grasp 
them together, as synthetically combined in an apperception, through 
the general expression I think. 

This principle, however, is not a principlea for every possible understanding, 
but only for one through whose pure apperception in the representation 
I am nothing manifold is given at all. That understanding 
through whose self-consciousness the manifold of intuition would at 
the same time be given, an understanding through whose representa

tion the objectsb of this representation would at the same time exist, 
would not require a special actC of the synthesis of the manifold for the 
unity of consciousness, which the hlunan understanding, which merely 
thinks, but does not intuit, does require. But for the human understanding 
it is unavoidably the first principle, so that the human understanding 
cannot even form for itself the least concept of another 
possible understanding, either one that would intuit itself or one that, 
while possessing a sensible intuition, would possess one of a different 
kind than one grounded in space and time. 


§ 18. 
What objective unity of self-consciousness is. 


The transcendental unity of apperception is that unity through 
which all of the manifold given in an intuition is united in a concept of 
the object.d It is called objective on that account, and must be distinguished 
from the subjective unity of consciousness, which is a determination 
of inner sense, through which that manifold of intuition is 
empirically given for such a combination. Whether I can become 
empirically conscious of the manifold as simultaneous or successive 
depends on the circumstances, or empirical conditions. Hence the em-
B 140 pirical unity of consciousness, through association of the representations, 
itself concerns an appearance, and is entirely contingent. The 
pure form of intuition in time, on the contrary, merely as intuition in 
general, which contains a given manifold, stands under the original 
unity of consciousness, solely by means of the necessary relation of the 
manifold of intuition to the one I think, thus through the pure synthesis 
of the understanding, which grounds a priori the empirical synthesis. 
That unity alone is objectivity valid; the empirical unity of 
apperception, which we are not assessing here, and which is also derived 
only from the former, under given conditions in concreto, has 

a Princip 
b Objecte 
, Actus 
d Object 


250 


Section II. Trans. deduction of pure concepts of understanding <B> 

merely subjective validity. One person combines the representation of 
a certain word with one thing, another with something else; and the 
unity of consciousness in that which is empirical is not, with regard to 
that which is given, necessarily and universally valid. 

§ 19· 
The logical form of all judgments consists in the 
objective unity of the apperception 
of the concepts contained therein.38 

I have never been able to satisfy myself with the explanation that the logicians 
give of a judgment in general: it is, they say, the representation 
of a relationa between two concepts. Without quarreling here about 
what is mistaken in this explanation, that in any case it fits only cate-B 141 
gorical but not hypothetical and disjunctive judgments (which latter 
two do not contain a relationb of concepts but of judgments themselves) 
(though from this error in logic many troublesome consequences have 
arisen),*,39 I remark only that it is not here determined wherein this relatione 
consists. 

If, however, I investigate more closely the relationd of given cognitions 
in every judgment, and distinguish that relation, as something belonging 
to the understanding, from the relatione in accordance with 
laws of the reproductive imagination (which has only subjective validity), 
then I find that a judgment is nothing other than the way to bring 
given cognitions to the objective unity of apperception.40 That is the 
aim of the copula! is in them: to distinguish the objective unity of given B 142 
representations from the subjective. For this word designates the relation 
of the representations to the original apperception and its necessary 
unity, even if the judgment itself is empirical, hence contingent, 

* The widespread doctrine of the four syllogistic figures concerns only the cat-B 141 
egorical inferences, and, although it is nothing more than an art for surreptitiously 
producing the illusion of more kinds of inference than that in the first 
figure by hiding immediate inferences (consequentiae immediatiae) among the 
premises of a pure syllogism, still it would not have achieved any special success 
by this alone if it had not succeeded in focusing attention exclusively on 
categorical judgments as those to which all others have to be related, which 
according to § 9, however, is false.

e.g., "Bodies are heavy." By that, to be sure, I do not mean to say that 
these representations necessarily belong to one another in the empirical 
intuition, but rather that they belong to one another in virtue of 
the necessary unity of the apperception in the synthesis of intuitions, 
i.e., in accordance with principles a of the objective determination of all 
representations insofar as cognition can come from them, which principlesb 
are all derived from the principle of the transcendental unity of 
apperception. Only in this way does there arise from this relatione a 
judgment, i.e., a relation that is objectively valid, and that is sufficiently 
distinguished from the relation of these same representations in 
which there would be only subjective validity, e.g., in accordance with 
laws of association. In accordance with the latter I could only say "If I 
carry a body, I feel a pressure of weight," but not "It, the body, is 
heavy," which would be to say that these two representations are combined 
in the object,d i.e., regardless of any difference in the condition of 
the subject, and are not merely found together in perception (however 
often as that might be repeated). 

§ 20. 
All sensible intuitions stand under the 
categories, as conditions under which alone 
their manifold can come together in one consciousness. 

The manifold that is given in a sensible intuition necessarily belongs 
under the original synthetic unity of apperception, since through this 
alone is the unity of the intuition possible (§ 17)' That action of the understanding, 
however, through which the manifold of given representations 
(whether they be intuitions or concepts) is brought under an 
apperception in general, is the logical function of judgments (§ I9)' 
Therefore all manifold, insofar as it is given in onee empirical intuition, 
is determined in regard to one of the logical functions for judgment, 
by means of which, namely, it is brought to a consciousness in general. 
But now the categories are nothing other than these very functions for 
judging, insofar as the manifold of a given intuition is determined with 
regard to them (§ I3).41 Thus the manifold in a given intuition also necessarily 
stands under categories.

§ 21. BI44 
Remark. 

A manifold that is contained in an intuition that I call mine is represented 
as belonging to the necessary unity of self-consciousness 
through the synthesis of the understanding, and this takes place by 
means of the category. * This indicates, therefore, that the empirical 
consciousness of a given manifold of onea intuition stands under a pure 
a priori self-consciousness, just as empirical intuitions stand under :1 
pure sensible one, which likewise holds a priori. -In the above proposition, 
therefore, the beginning of a deduction of the pure concepts of 
the understanding has been made, in which, since the categories arise 
independently from sensibility merely in the understanding, I must 
abstract from the way in which the manifold for an empirical intuition 
is given, in order to attend only to the unity that is added to the intuition 
through the understanding by means of the category. In the sequel 
(§ 26) it will be shown from the way in which the empirical intuition is 
given in sensibility that its unity can be none other than the one the cat-B 145 
egory prescribes to the manifold of a given intuition in general according 
to the preceding § 20; thus by the explanation of itsb a priori validity 
in regard to all objects of our senses the aim of the deduction will first 
be fully attained. 

In the above proof, however, I still could not abstract from one point, 
namely, from the fact that the manifold for intuition must already be 
given prior to the synthesis of understanding and independently from 
it; how, however, is here left undetermined. For if I wanted to think of 
an understanding that itself intuited (as, say, a divine understanding, 
which would not represent given objects, but through whose representation 
the objects would themselves at the same time be given, or produced), 
then the categories would have no significance at all with regard 
to such a cognition. They are only rules for an understanding whose entire 
capacityc consists in thinking, i.e., in the action of bringing the synthesis 
of the manifold that is given to it in intuition from elsewhere to 
the unity of apperception, which therefore cognizes nothing at all by

itself, a but only combines and orders the material for cognition, the intuition, 
which must be given to it through the object.b But for the peculiarity 
of our understanding, that it is able to bring about the unity of 
apperception a priori only by means of the categories and only through 

B I46 precisely this kind and number of them, a further ground may be offered 
just as little as one can be offered for why we have precisely these 
and no other functions for judgment or for why space and time are the 
sole forms of our possible intuition. 

B 147 
§ 22. 


The category has no otheruse for 
the cognition of things than its application 
to objects of experience. 

To think of an object and to cognize an object are thus not the same. 
For two components belong to cognition: first, the concept, through 
which an object is thought at all (the category), and second, the intuition, 
through which it is given; for if an intuition corresponding to the 
concept could not be given at all, then it would be a thought as far as its 
form is concerned, but without any object, and by its means no cognition 
of anything at all would be possible, since, as far as I would know, 
nothing would be given nor could be given to which my thought could 
be applied. Now all intuition that is possible for us is sensible (Aesthetic), 
thus for us thinking of an object in general through a pure concept 
of the understanding can become cognition only insofar as this 
concept is related to objects of the senses. Sensible intuition is either 
pure intuition (space and time) or empirical intuition of that which, 
through sensation, is immediately represented as real in space and time. 
Through determination of the former we can acquire a priori cognitions 
of objects (in mathematics), but only as far as their form is concerned, 
as appearances; whether there can be things that must be intuited in this 
form is still left unsettled. Consequently all mathematical concepts are 
not by themselves cognitions, except insofar as one presupposes that 
there are things that can be presented to us only in accordance with the 
form of that pure sensible intuition. Things in space and time, however, 
are only given insofar as they are perceptions (representations accompanied 
with sensation), hence through empirical representation. 
The pure concepts of the understanding, consequently, even if they are 
applied to a priori intuitions (as in mathematics), provide cognition only 
insofar as these a priori intuitions, and by means of them also the concepts 
of the understanding, can be applied to empirical intuitions. Con

sequently the categories do not afford us cognition of things by means 
of intuition except through their possible application to empirical intuition, 
i.e., they serve only for the possibility of empirical cognition. 
This, however, is called experience. The categories consequently have 
no other use for the cognition of things except insofar as these are taken B 148 
as objects of possible experience. 


The above proposition is of the greatest importance, for it determines 
the boundaries of the use of the pure concepts of the understanding in 
regard to objects, just as the Transcendental Aesthetic determined the 


boundaries of the use of the pure form of our sensible intuition. Space 
and time are valid, as conditions of the possibility of how objects can be 
given to us, no further than for objects of the senses, hence only for experience. 
Beyond these boundaries they do not represent anything at 
all, for they are only in the senses and outside of them have no reality. 
The pure concepts of the understanding are free from this limitation 
and extend to objects of intuition in general, whether the latter be similar 
to our own or not, as long as it is sensible and not intellectual. But 
this further extension of concepts beyond our sensible intuition does 
not get us anywhere. For they are then merely empty concepts of objects,
a through which we cannot even judge whether the latter are possible 
or not -mere forms of thought without objective reality -since 
we have available no intuition to which the synthetic unity of apperception, 
which they alone contain, could be applied, and that could thus 
determine an object. Our sensible and empirical intuition alone can B 149 
provide them with sense and significance. 

Thus if one assumes an objectb of a non-sensible intuition as given, 
one can certainly represent it through all of the predicates that already 
lie in the presupposition that nothing belonging to sensible intuition 
pertains to it: thus it is not extended, or in space, that its duration is 
not a time, that no alteration (sequence of determinations in time) is to 
be encountered in it, etc. But it is not yet a genuine cognition ifI merely 
indicate what the intuition of the object' is not, without being able to 
say what is then contained in it; for then I have not represented the possibility 
of an objectd for my pure concept of the understanding at all, 
since I cannot give any intuition that would correspond to it, but could 
only say that ours is not valid for it. But what is most important here is 
that not even a single category could be applied to such a thing, e.g., the

concept of a substance, i.e., that of something that could exist as a subject 
but never as a mere predicate; for I would not even know whether 
there could be anything that corresponded to this determination of 
thought if empirical intuition did not give me the case for its application. 
But more of this in the sequel. 

BI50 § 24· 
On the application of the categories to objects 
ofthe senses in general. 


The pure concepts of the understanding are related through the mere 
understanding to objects of intuition in general, without it being determined 
whether this intuition is our own or some other but still sensible 
one, but they are on this account mere forms of thought, through 
which no determinate object is yet cognized. The synthesis or combination 
of the manifold in them was related merely to the unity of apperception, 
and was thereby the ground of the possibility of cognition 
a priori insofar as it rests on the understanding, and was therefore not 
only transcendental but also merely purely intellectual. But since in us 
a certain form of sensible intuition a priori is fundamental, which rests 
on the receptivity of the capacity for representation (sensibility), the 
understanding, as spontaneity, can determine the manifold of given representations 
in accord with the synthetic unity of apperception, and 
thus think a priori synthetic unity of the apperception of the manifold 
of sensible intuition, as the condition under which all objects of our 
(human) intuition must necessarily stand, through which then the categories, 
as mere forms of thought, acquire objective reality, i.e., applica-

B 151 tion to objects that can be given to us in intuition, but only as appearances; 
for of these alone are we capable of intuition a priori. 
This synthesis of the manifold of sensible intuition, which is possible 
and necessary a priori, can be called figurative (synthesis speciosa), as distinct 
from that which would be thought in the mere category in regard 
to the manifold of an intuition in general, and which is called combination 
of the understanding (synthesis intellectualis); both are transcendental, 
not merely because they themselves proceed a priori but also because 
they ground the possibility of other cognition a priori. 
Yet the figurative synthesis, if it pertains merely to the original synthetic 
unity of apperception, i.e., this transcendental unity, which is 
thought in the categories, must be called, as distinct from the merely intellectual 
combination, the transcendental synthesis of the imagination. 
Imaginationa is the faculty for representing an object even without 
its presence in intuition. Now since all of our intuition is sensible, 

a Here Kant uses both large type and spacing for extra emphasis. 


256 


Section II. Trans. deduction of pure concepts of understanding <B> 

the imagination, on account of the subjective condition under which 
alone it can give a corresponding intuition to the concepts of understanding, 
belongs to sensibility; but insofar as its synthesis is still an exercise 
of spontaneity, which is determining and not, like sense, merely 
determinable, and can thus determine the form of sense a priori in ac-B 152 
cordance with the unity of apperception, the imagination is to this extent 
a faculty for determining the sensibility a priori, and its synthesis of 
intuitions, in accordance with the categories, must be the transcendental 
synthesis of the imagination, which is an effect of the understanding 
on sensibility and its first application (and at the same time 
the ground of all others) to objects of the intuition that is possible for 
us. As figurative, it is distinct from the intellectual synthesis without 
any imagination merely through the understanding. Now insofar as the 
imagination is spontaneity, I also occasionally call it the productive 
imagination, and thereby distinguish it from the reproductive imagination, 
whose synthesis is subject solely to empirical laws, namely those 
of association, and that therefore contributes nothing to the explanation 
of the possibility of cognition a priori, and on that account belongs not 
in transcendental philosophy but in psychology. 

* * * 

Here is now the place to make intelligible the paradox that must have 
struck everyone in the exposition of the form of inner sense (§ 6): 
namely how this presents even ourselves to consciousness only as we 
appear to ourselves, not as we are in ourselves, since we intuit ourselves B 153 
only as we are internally affected, which seems to be contradictory, 
since we would have to relate to ourselves passively; for this reason it is 
customary in the systems of psychology to treat inner sense as the 
same as the faculty of apperception (which we carefully distinguish)Y 

That which determines the inner sense is the understanding and its 
original faculty of combining the manifold of intuition, i.e., of bringing 
it under an apperception (as that on which its very possibility rests). 
Now since in us humans the understanding is not itself a faculty of intuitions, 
and even if these were given in sensibility cannot take them 
up into itself, in order as it were to combine the manifold of its own 
intuition, thus its synthesis, considered in itselfa alone, is nothing other 
than the unity of the action of which it is conscious as such even without 
sensibility, but through which it is capable of itself determining 
sensibility internally with regard to the manifold that may be given to 
it in accordance with the form of its intuition. Under the designation 
of a transcendental synthesis of the imagination, it therefore exer


a for sich 


257 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. I. Bk. I. Ch. II. <B> 


cises that action on the passive subject, whose faculty it is, about 

B 154 which we rightly say that the inner sense is thereby affected. Apperception 
and its synthetic unity is so far from being the same as the 
inner sense that the former, rather, as the source of all combination, 
applies to all sensible intuition of objects a in general, to the manifold 
of intuitions in general, under the name of the categories; inner 
sense, on the contrary, contains the mere form of intuition, but without 
combination of the manifold in it, and thus it does not yet contain 
any determinate intuition at all, which is possible only through the 
consciousness of the determination of the manifold through the transcendental 
action of the imagination (synthetic influence of the understanding 
on the inner sense), which I have named the figurative 
synthesis. 

We also always perceive this in ourselves. We cannot think of a line 
without drawing it in thought, we cannot think of a circle without describing 
it, we cannot represent the three dimensions of space at all 
without placing three lines perpendicular to each other at the same 
point, and we cannot even represent time without, in drawing a 
straight line (which is to be the external figurative representation of 
time), attending merely to the action of the synthesis of the manifold 
through which we successively determine the inner sense, and thereby 
attending to the succession of this determination in inner sense. 

B ISS Motion, as action of the subject (not as determination of an object),*,b 
consequently the synthesis of the manifold in space, if we abstract from 
this manifold in space and attend solely to the action in accordance with 
which we determine the form of inner sense, first produces the concept 
of succession at all. The understanding therefore does not find 
some sort of combination of the manifold already in inner sense, but 
produces it, by affecting inner sense. But how the I that I think is to 
differ from the I that intuits itself (for I can represent other kinds of intuition 
as at least possible) and yet be identical with the latter as the 
same subject, how therefore I can say that I as intelligence and think


* Motion of an object' in space does not belong in a pure science, thus also not 
in geometry; for that something is movable cannot be cognized a priori but 
only through experience. But motion, as description of a space, is a pure acrt 
of the successive synthesis of the manifold in outer intuition in general 
through productive imagination, and belongs not only to geometry but even 
to transcendental philosophy.

ingsubject cognize my self as an objecta that is thought, insofar as I am

am for the understanding but rather as I appear to myself, this is no 
more and no less difficult than how I can be an objectb for myself in 
general and indeed one of intuition and inner perceptions. But that it B 156 
really must be so can be clearly shown, if one lets space count as a mere 
pure form of the appearances of outer sense, from the fact that time, although 
is not itself an object of outer intuition at all, cannot be made 
representable to us except under the image of a line, insofar as we draw 
it, without which sort of presentation we could not know the unity of 
its measure at all, or likewise from the fact that we must always derive 
the determination of the length of time or also of the positions in time 
for all inner perceptions from that which presents external things to us 
as alterable; hence we must order the determinations of inner sense as 
appearances in time in just the same way as we order those of outer 
sense in space; hence if we admit about the latter that we cognize objectsC 
by their means only insofar as we are externally affected, then we 
must also concede that through inner sense we intuit ourselves only as 
we are internally affected by our selves, i.e., as far as inner intuition is 
concerned we cognize our own subject only as appearance but not in accordance 
with what it is in itself.*A3

In the transcendental synthesis of the manifold of representations in 
general, on the contrary, hence in the synthetic original unity of apperception, 
I am conscious of myself not as I appear to myself, nor as I am 
in myself, but only that I am. This representation is a thinking, not 
an intuiting. Now since for the cognition of ourselves, in addition to 
the action of thinking that brings the manifold of every possible intuition

is not indeed appearance (let alone mere illusion), but the determination 
of my existence*>44 can only occur in correspondence with the form 
of inner sense, according to the particular way in which the manifold 
that I combine is given in inner intuition, and I therefore have no cognition 
of myself as I am, but only as I appear to myself. The consciousness 
of oneself is therefore far from being a cognition of oneself, 
regardless of all the categories that constitute the thinking of an objeCt" 
in general through combination of the manifold in an apperception. 
Just as for the cognition of an objectb distinct from me I also need an 
intuition in addition to the thinking of an objectC in general (in the category), 
through which I determine that general concept, so for the cognition 
of myself I also need in addition to the consciousness, or in 
addition to that which I think myself, an intuition of the manifold in 
me, through which I determine this thought; and I exist as an intelligence 
that is merely conscious of its faculty for combination but which, 

B 159 in regard to the manifold that it is to combine, is subject to a limiting 
condition that it calls inner sense, which can make that combination intuitable 
only in accordance with temporal relationsd that lie entirely 
outside of the concepts of the understanding proper, and that can therefore 
still cognize itself merely as it appears to itself with regard to an intuition 
(which is not intellectual and capable of being given through the 
understanding itself), not as it would cognize itself if its intuition were 
intellectual. 

* The I think expresses the act" of determining my existence. The existence is 
thereby already given, but the way in which I am to determine it, i.e., the manifold 
that I am to posit in myself as belonging to it, is not yet thereby given. 
For that self-intuition is required, which is grounded in an a priori given form, 
i.e., time, which is sensible and belongs to the receptivity of the determinable. 
B 158 Now I do not have yet another self-intuition, which would give the determining 
in me, of the spontaneity of which alone I am conscious, even before 
the actf of determination, in the same way as time gives that which is to be 
determined, thus I cannot determine my existence as that of a self-active 
being, rather I merely represent the spontaneity of my thought, i.e., of the determining, 
and my existence always remains only sensibly determinable, i.e., 
determinable as the existence of an appearance. Yet this spontaneity is the reason 
I call myself an intelligence.

Section II. Trans. deduction of pure concepts of understanding <B> 

§ 26. 

Transcendental deduction of the universally possible 
use of the pure 
concepts of the understanding in experience. 

In the metaphysical deduction45 the origin of the a priori categories in 
general was established through their complete coincidence with the 
universal logical functions of thinking, in the transcendental deduction, 
however, their possibility as a priori cognitions of objects of an intuition 
in general was exhibited (§§ 20, 2 I). Now the possibility of 
cognizing a priori through categories whatever objects may come before 
our senses, not as far as the form of their intuition but rather as 
far as the laws of their combination are concerned, thus the possibility 
of as it were prescribing the law to nature and even making the latter 
possible, is to be explained. For if the categories did not serve in this B 160 
way, it would not become clear why everything that may ever come before 
our senses must stand under the laws that arise a priori from the understanding 
alone. 

First of all I remark that by the synthesis of apprehension I understand 
the composition of the manifold in an empirical intuition, 
through which perception, i.e., empirical consciousness of it (as appearance), 
becomes possible. 

We have forms of outer as well as inner sensible intuition a priori in 
the representations of space and time, and the synthesis of the apprehension 
of the manifold of appearance must always be in agreement 
with the latter, since it can only occur in accordance with this form. But 
space and time are represent.ed a priori not merely as forms of sensible 
intuition, but also as intuitions themselves (which contain a manifold), 
and thus with the determination of the unity of this manifold in them 
(see the Transcendental Aesthetic).*A6 Thus even unity of the synthe-B 161 

* Space, represented as object(as is really required in geometry), contains more B 160 
than the mere form of intuition, namely the comprehensiona of the manifold 
given in accordance with the form of sensibility in an intuitive representation, 
so that the form of intuition merely gives the manifold, but the formal intuitiongives 
unity of the representation. In the Aesthetic I ascribed this unity 
merely to sensibility, only in order to note that it precedes all concepts, B 161 
though to be sure it presupposes a synthesis, which does not belong to the 
senses but through which all concepts of space and time first become possible. 
, For since through it (as the understanding determines the sensibility) space or 
time are first given as intuitions, the unity of this a priori intuition belongs to 
space and time, and not to the concept of the understanding (§ 24) . 

• ZusammenJassung

sis of the manifold, outside or within us, hence also a combination 
with which everything that is to be represented as determined in space 
or time must agree, is already given a priori, along with (not in) these 
intuitions, as condition of the synthesis of all apprehension. But this 
synthetic unity can be none other than that of the combination of the 
manifold of a given intuition in general in an original consciousness, 
in agreement with the categories, only applied to our sensible intuition. 
Consequently all synthesis, through which even perception itself 
becomes possible, stands under the categories, and since experience is 
cognition through connected perceptions, the categories are conditions 
of the possibility of experience, and are thus also valid a priori of all objects 
of experience. 

* * * 

B 162 Thus if, e.g., I make the empirical intuition of a house into perception 
through apprehension of its manifold, my ground is the necessary 
unity of space and of outer sensible intuition in general, and I as it were 
draw its shape in agreement with this synthetic unity of the manifold in 
space. This very same synthetic unity, however, if I abstract from the 
form of space, has its seat in the understanding, and is the category of 
the synthesis of the homogeneous in an intuition in general, i.e., the 
category of quantity,a with which that synthesis of apprehension, i.e., 
the perception, must therefore be in thoroughgoing agreement.* 

If (in another example) I perceive the freezing of water, I apprehend 
two states (of fluidity and solidity) as ones standing in a relationb of time 
to each other. But in time, on which I ground the appearance as inner 
intuition, I represent necessary synthetic unity of the manifold, without 
which that relatione could not be determinate1y given in an intuition 
(with regard to the temporal sequence). But now this synthetic 
unity, as the a priori condition under which I combine the manifold of 
an intuition in general, if I abstract from the constant form of my 
inner intuition, time, is the category of cause, through which, if! apply 
it to my sensibility, I determine everything that happens in time in 

B 163 
B 162 * In such a way it is proved that the synthesis of apprehension, which is empirical, 
must necessarily be in agreement with the synthesis of apperception, 
which is intellectual and contained in the category entirely a priori. It is one 
and the same spontaneity that, there under the name of imagination and here 
under the name of understanding, brings combination into the manifold of 
intuition.

general as far as its relation° is concerned. Thus the apprehension in 
such an occurrence, hence the occurrence itself, as far as possible perception 
is concerned, stands under the concept of the relationb of effects 
and causes, and so in all other cases. 

* * * 

Categories are concepts that prescribe laws a priori to appearances, 
thus to nature as the sum total of all appearances (natura materialiter 
spectata),c and, since they are not derived from nature and do not follow 
it as their pattern (for they would otherwise be merely empirical), the 
question now arises how it is to be conceived that nature must follow 
them, i.e., how they can determine a priori the combination of the manifold 
of nature without deriving from the latter. Here is the solution to 
this riddle. 

It is by no means stranger that the laws of appearances in nature must B 164 
agree with the understanding and its a priori form, i.e., its faculty of 
combining the manifold in general, than that the appearances themselves 
must agree with the form of sensible intuition a priori. For laws 
exist just a little in the appearances, but rather exist only relative to the 
subject in which the appearances inhere, insofar as it has understanding, 
as appearances do not exist in themselves, but only relative to the same 
being, insofar as it has senses. The lawfulness of things in themselves 
would necessarily pertain to them even without an understanding that 
cognizes them. But appearances are only representations of things that 
exist without cognition of what they might be in themselves. As mere 
representations, however, they stand under no law of connection at all 
except that which the connecting faculty prescribes. Now that which 
connects the manifold of sensible intuition is imagination, which depends 
on understanding for the unity of its intellectual synthesis and on 
sensibility for the manifoldness of apprehension. Now since all possible 
perception depends on the synthesis of apprehension, but the latter itself, 
this empirical synthesis, depends on the transcendental one, thus 
on the categories, all possible perceptions, hence everything that can 
ever reach empirical consciousness, i.e., all appearances of nature, as far B r65 
as their combination is concerned,47 stand under the categories, on 
which nature (considered merely as nature in general) depends, as the 
original ground of its necessary lawfulness (as natura flrmaliter spectata).

prescribe to the appearances through mere categories a priori laws 
beyond those on which rests a nature in general, as lawfulness of appearances 
in space and time. Particular laws, because they concern empirically 
determined appearances, cannot be completely derived from 
the categories, although they all stand under them. Experience must be 
added in order to come to know particular laws at all; but about experience 
in general, and about what can be cognized as an object of experience, 
only those a priori laws offer instruction. 

§ 2s7· 

Result of this deduction of the concepts of the understanding. 

B 166 
We cannot think any object except through categories; we cannot cognize 
any object that is thought except through intuitions that correspond 
to those concepts. Now all our intuitions are sensible, and this 
cognition, so far as its object is given, is empirical. Empirical cognition, 
however, is experience. Consequently no a priori cognition is possible 
for us except solely of objects of possible experience.* 

But this cognition, which is limited merely to objects of experience, 
is not on that account all borrowed from experience; rather, with regard 
to the pure intuitions as well as the pure concepts of the understanding, 
there are elements of cognition that are to be encountered in us a priori. 
Now there are only two ways in which a necessary agreement of 
experience with the concepts of its objects can be thought: either the 
experience makes these concepts possible or these concepts make the 

B 167 experience possible. The first is not the case with the categories (nor 
with pure sensible intuition); for they are a priori concepts, hence independent 
of experience (the assertion of an empirical origin would be a 
sort of generatio aequivoca).a Consequently only the second way remains 

B r66 * So that one may not prematurely take issue with the worrisome and disadvantageous 
consequences of this proposition, I will only mention that the categories 
are not restricted in thinking by the conditions of our sensible 
intuition, but have an unbounded field, and only the cognitionof objects that 
we think, the determination of the object,b requires intuition; in the absence 
of the latter, the thought of the object' can still have its true and useful consequences 
for the use of the subject's reason, which, however, cannot be expounded 
here, for it is not always directed to the determination of the object, 
thus to cognition, but rather also to that of the subject and its willing.

general from the side of the understanding. But more about how they 
make experience possible, and which principles of its possibility they 
yield in their application to appearances, will be taught in the following 
chapter on the transcendental use of the power of judgment. 

If someone still wanted to propose a middle way between the only 
two, already named ways, namely, that the categories were neither selfthought 
a priori first principlesa of our cognition nor drawn from experience, 
but were rather subjective predispositions for thinking, 
implanted in us along with our existence by our author in such a way 
that their use would agree exactly with the laws of nature along which 
experience runs (a kind of prefonnation-system49 of pure reason), 
then (besides the fact that on such a hypothesis no end can be seen to 
how far one might drive the presupposition of predetermined predispositions 
for future judgments) this would be decisive against the supposed 
middle way: that in such a case the categories would lack the B 168 
necessity that is essential to their concept. For, e.g., the concept of 
cause, which asserts the necessity of a consequent under a presupposed 
condition, would be false if it rested only on a subjective necessity, arbitrarily 
implanted in us, of combining certain empirical representations 
according to such a rule of relation.b I would not be able to say 
that the effect is combined with the cause in the object:" (i.e., necessarily), 
but only that I am so constituted that I cannot think of this representation 
otherwise than as so connected; which is precisely what the 
skeptic wishes most, for then all of our insight through the supposed 
objective validity of our judgments is nothing but sheer illusion, and 
there would be no shortage of people who would not concede this subjective 
necessity (which must be felt) on their own; at least one would 
not be able to quarrel with anyone about that which merely depends on 
the way in which his subject is organized. 


Brief concept of this deduction. 

It is the exhibition of the pure concepts of the understanding (and with 
them of all theoretical cognition a priori) as principlesd of the possibility 
of experience, but of the latter as the detennination of appearances

The Transcendental Analytic BI69 
Second Book 
The Analytic of Principles 

General logic is constructed on a plan that corresponds quite precisely 
with the division of the higher faculties of cognition. These are: understanding, 
the power of judgment, and reason. In its analytic that 
doctrine accordingly deals with concepts, judgments, and inferences, 
corresponding exactly to the functions and the order of those powers of A 131 
mind, which are comprehended under the broad designation of understanding 
in general. 

Since merely formal logic, so conceived, abstracts from all content of B 170 
cognition (whether it be pure or empirical), and concerns itself merely 
with the form of thinking (of discursive cognition) in general, it can also 
include in its analytical part the canon for reason, the form of which has 
its secure precept, into which there can be a priori insight through mere 
analysis of the actions of reason into their moments, without taking into 
consideration the particular nature of the cognition about which it is 
employed. 


Transcendental logic, since it is limited to a determinate content, 
namely that of pure a priori cognitions alone, cannot imitate general 
logic in this division. For it turns out that the transcendental use of 
reason is not objectively valid at all, thus does not belong to the logic 
of truth, i.e., the analytic, but rather, as a logic of illusion, requires a 
special part of the scholastic edifice, under the name of the transcendental 
dialectic. 

Understanding and the power of judgment accordingly have their 
canon of objectively valid, thus true use in transcendental logic, and 
therefore belong in its analytical part. Only reason in its attempts to 
make out something about objects a priori and to extend cognition beyond 
the bounds of possible experience is wholly and entirely dialecti-B 171/ Alp 
cal, and its illusory assertions do not fit into a canon of the sort that the 
analytic ought to contain. 

The analytic of principles will accordingly be solely a canon for the 
power of judgment that teaches it to apply to appearances the concepts 
of the understanding, which contain the condition for rules a pri

as my theme I will make use of the designation of a doctrine of the 
power of judgment, through which this enterprise may be more precisely 
designated. 

Introduction 
On the transcendental power of judgment 
in general. 

If the understanding in general is explained as the faculty of rules, then 
the power of judgment is the faculty of subsuming under rules, i.e., of 
determining whether something stands under a given rule (casus datae 
legis)h or not. General logic contains no precepts at all for the power of 
judgment, and moreover cannot contain them. For since it abstracts 
from all content of cognition, nothing remains to it but the business 
of analytically dividing the mere form of cognition into concepts, judgments, 
and inferences, and thereby achieving formal rules for all use of 
the understanding. Now if it wanted to show generally how one ought 
to subsume under these rules, i.e., distinguish whether something 
stands under them or not, this could not happen except once again 
through a rule. But just because this is a rule, it would demand another 
instruction for the power of judgment, and so it becomes clear that although 
the understanding is certainly capable of being instructed and 
equipped through rules, the power of judgment is a special talent that 
cannot be taught but only practiced. Thus this is also what is specific to 
so-called mother-wit, the lack of which cannot be made good by any 
school; for,c although such a school can provide a limited understanding 
with plenty of rules borrowed from the insight of others and as it were 
graft these onto it, nevertheless the faculty for making use of them correctly 
must belong to the student himself, and in the absence of such a 
natural gift no rule that one might prescribe to him for this aim is safe 
from misuse.*,d A physician therefore, a judge, or a statesman, can have 

* The lack of the power of judgment is that which is properly called stupidity, 
and such a failing is not to be helped. A dull or limited head, which is lacking 
nothing but the appropriate degree of understanding and its proper concepts, 
may well be trained through instruction, even to the point of becoming 
learned. But since it would usually still lack the power of judgment (the secunda

many fine pathological, juridical, or political rules in his head, of which 
he can even be a thorough teacher, and yet can easily stumble in their 
application, either because he is lacking in natural power of judgment 
(though not in understanding), and to be sure understands the universal 
in abstracto but" cannot distinguish whether a case in concreto belongs 
under it, or also because he has not received adequate training for this 
judgment through examples and actual business. This is also the sole 
and great utility of examples: that they sharpen the power of judgment. 
F or as far as the correctness and precision of the insight of the understanding 
is concerned, examples more usually do it some damage, since 
they only seldom adequately fulfill the condition of the rule (as casus in 
terminis)b and beyond this often weaken the effort of the understanding 
to gain sufficient insight into rules in the universal and independently 
of the particular circumstances of experience, and thus in the end accustom 
us to use those rules more like formulas than like principles. 
Thus examples are the leading-strings of the power of judgment, which B 174 
he who lacks the natural talent for judgment can never do without. 50 

But now although general logic can give no precepts to the power AI 3 5 
of judgment, things are quite different with transcendental logic, so 
that it even seems that the latter has as its proper business to correct 
and secure the power of judgment in the use of the pure understanding 
through determinate rules. For although for expansion of the role of 
the understanding in the field of pure cognitions a priori, hence as a 
doctrine, philosophy seems entirely unnecessary or rather ill-suited, 
since after all its previous attempts little or no territory has been won, 
yet as critique, in order to avoid missteps in judgment (lapsus judici)d in 
the use of the few pure concepts of the understanding that we have, philosophy 
with all of its perspicacity and art of scrutiny is called up (even 
though its utility is then only negative). 

But the peculiar thing about transcendental philosophy is this: that in 
addition to the rule (or rather the general condition for rules), which is 
given in the pure concept of the understanding, it can at the same time 
indicate a priori the case to which the rules ought to be applied. The B 175 
cause of the advantage that it has in this regard over all other didactic 
sciences (except for mathematics) lies just here: that it deals with con

A 136 validity cannot be established a posteriori, for that would leave that dignity

a general but sufficient characterization of the conditions under which 
objects in harmony with those concepts can be given, for otherwise they 
would be without all content, and thus would be mere logical forms and 
not pure concepts of the understanding. 
This transcendental doctrine of the power of judgment will contain 
two chapters: the first, which deals with the sensible condition 
under which alone pure concepts of the understanding can be employed, 
i.e., with the schematism of the pure understanding; and the second, 
which deals with those synthetic judgments that How a priori from pure 
concepts of the understanding under these conditions and ground all 
other cognitions a priori, i.e., with the principles of pure understanding.

of the Power of Judgment 
(or Analytic of Principles) 

First Chapter 
On the schematismb of the 
pure concepts of the understanding5I 
In all subsumptions of an object under a concept the representations of 
the former must be homogeneous with the latter, i.e., the concept 
must contain that which is represented in the object that is to be subsumed 
under it, for that is just what is meant by the expression "an object 
is contained under a concept." Thus the empirical concept of a 
plate has homogeneity with the pure geometrical concept of a circle, 
for the roundness that is thought in the former can be intuited in the 
latter. 

Now pure concepts of the understanding, however, in comparison 
with empirical (indeed in general sensible) intuitions, are entirely unhomogeneous, 
and can never be encountered in any intuition. Now 

n 

The following notes pertaining to the general argument of the next section are all in


serted on A I 3 7 in Kant's copy of the first edition: 
"We cannot think any intuitions or relations [Verhiiltni.l:,e] of intuitions for the cate


gories, rather they must be given in experience. Thus all principles pertain merely to 

possible experience, since this is possible only in accordance with the form of the unity 

of understanding." (E LUI, p. 27; 23:a27) 
"The incomprehensibility of the categories sterns from the fact that we cannot have 

insight into the synthetic unity of apperception." (E LIv, p. 27; 23:27) 

"The schema of time a line." (E LV; p. 27; 23:27) 

"The possibility of an object [Objects] of the concept of the understanding, e.g., a 

cause or alf1tntcrciultt, cannot be thought a priori, consequently only an experience can 

be thought with the conditions under which it can become experience in combination 

with the concept of the understanding." (E LVI, p. 27; 23:27) 
b Kant's copy of the first edition adds this note: "The synthesis of the understanding is 

called thus if it determines the inner sense in accordance with the unity of appercep


tion." (E LVII, p. 27; 23:27) 

271 



Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. I. Bk. II. Ch. I 

how is the subsumption of the latter under the former, thus the application 
of the category to appearances possible, since no one would say 

BI77/AI38 that the category, e.g., causality, could also be intuited through the 
senses and is contained in the appearance? This question, so natural and 
important, is really the cause which makes a transcendental doctrine of 
the power of judgment necessary, in order, namely, to show the possibility 
of applying pure concepts of the understanding to appearances 
in general. In all other sciences, where the concepts through which the 
object is thought in general are not so different and heterogeneous 
from those that represent it in concreto, as it is given, it is unnecessary to 
offer a special discussion of the application of the former to the latter. 
Now it is clear that there must be a third thing, which must stand in 
homogeneity with the category on the one hand and the appearance on 
the other, and makes possible the application of the former to the latter. 
This mediating representation must be pure (without anything empirical) 
and yet intellectual on the one hand and sensible on the other. 
Such a representation is the transcendental schema. 
The concept of the understanding contains pure synthetic unity of 
the manifold in general. Time, as the formal condition of the manifold 
of inner sense, thus of the connection of all representations, contains an 
a priori manifold in pure intuition. Now a transcendental time-determination 
is homogeneous with the category (which constitutes its 
B 178 unity) insofar as it is universal and rests on a rule a priori. But it is on 
A 139 the other hand homogeneous with the appearance insofar as time is 
contained in every empirical representation of the manifold. Hence an 
application of the category to appearances becomes possible by means 
of the transcendental time-determination which, as the schema of the 
concept of the understanding, mediates the subsumption of the latter 
under the former. 
After what has been shown in the deduction of the categories, hopefully 
no one will be in doubt about how to decide the question, whether 
these pure concepts of the understanding are of merely empirical or also 
of transcendental use, i.e., whether, as conditions of a possible experience, 
they relate a priori solely to appearances, or whether, as conditions 
of the possibility of things in general, they can be extended to objects in 
themselves (without any restriction to our sensibility). For we have seen 
there that concepts are entirely impossible,a and cannot have any significance, 
where an object is not given either for them themselves or at 
least for the elements of which they consist, consequently they cannot 
pertain to things in themselves (without regard to how and whether they 
may be given to us) at all; that, further, the modification of our sensibil

ity is the only way in which objects are given to us; and, finally, that pure 
concepts a priori, in addition to the function of the understanding in the B 179 
category, must also contain a priori formal conditions of sensibility A 140 
(namely of the inner sense) that contain the general condition under 
which alone the category can be applied to any object. We will call this 
formal and pure condition of the sensibility, to which the use of the concept 
of the understanding is restricted, the schema of this concept of 
the understanding, and we will call the procedure of the understanding 
with these schemata the schematism of the pure understanding. 

The schema is in itself always only a product of the imagination; but 
since the synthesis of the latter has as its aim no individual intuition but 
rather only the unity in the determination of sensibility, the schema is 
to be distinguished from an image. Thus, if I place five points in a 
row, ..... , this is an image of the number five. On the contrary, if I 
only think a number in general, which could be five or a hundred, this 
thinking is more the representation of a method for representing a multitude 
(e.g., a thousand) in accordance with a certain concept than the 
image itself, which in this case I could survey and compare with the 
concept only with difficulty. Now this representation of a general procedure 
of the imagination for providing a concept with its image is what B 180 
I call the schema for this concept. 

In fact it is not images of objects but schemata that ground our pure 
sensible conceptsY No image of a triangle would ever be adequate to AI41 
the concept of it. For it would not attain the generality of the concept, 
which makes this valid for all triangles, right or acute, etc., but would 
always be limited to one part of this sphere. The schema of the triangle 
can never exist anywhere except in thought, and signifies a rule of the 
synthesis of the imagination with regard to pure shapes in space. Even 
less does an object of experience or an image of it ever reach the empirical 
concept, rather the latter is always related immediately to the 
schema of the imagination, as a rule for the determination of our intuition 
in accordance with a certain general concept. The concept of a 
dog signifies a rule in accordance with which my imagination can specify 
the shape of a four-footed animal in general, without being restricted 
to any single particular shape that experience offers me or any 
possible image that I can exhibit in concreto. This schematism of our understanding 
with regard to appearances and their mere form is a hidden 
art in the depths of the human soul, whose true operations we can di-B 181 
vine from nature and lay unveiled before our eyes only with difficulty. 
We can say only this much: the image is a product of the empirical faculty 
of productive imagination, the schema of sensible concepts (such

A 142 as figures in space) is a product and as it were a monogram of pure a priori 
imagination, through which and in accordance with which the images 
first become possible, but which must be connected with the 
concept, to which they are in themselves never fully congruent, always 
only by means of the schema that they designate. The schema of a pure 
concept of the understanding, on the contrary, is something that can 
never be brought to an image at all, but is rather only the pure synthesis, 
in accord with a rule of unity according to concepts in general, 
which the category expresses, and is a transcendental product of the 
imagination, which concerns the determination of the inner sense in 
general, in accordance with conditions of itsa form (time) in regard to 
all representations, insofar as these are to be connected together a priori 
in one concept in accord with the unity of apperception. 


Rather than pausing now for a dry and boring analysis of what is required 
for transcendental schemata of pure concepts of the understanding 
in general, we would rather present them according to the order of 
the categories and in connection with these. 

B 182 The pure image of all magnitudes (quantorum) for outer sense is 
space; for all objects of the senses in general, it is time. The pure 
schema of magnitude (quantitatis), however, as a concept of the understanding, 
is number, which is a representation that summarizes the 
successive addition of one (homogeneous) unit to another. Thus num-

A 143 ber is nothing other than the unity of the synthesis of the manifold of a 
homogeneous intuition in general, becauseb I generate time itself in the 
apprehension of the intuition.53 
Realityc is in the pure concept of the understanding that to which a 
sensationd in general corresponds, that, therefore, the concept of which 
in itself indicates a being (in time). Negation is that the concept of 
which represents a non-being (in time). The opposition of the two thus 
takes place in the distinction of one and the same time as either a filled 
or an empty time. Since time is only the form of intuition, thus of objects 
as appearances, that which corresponds to the sensation in these is 
the transcendental matter of all objects, as things in themselves (thing

all a priori cognition. Only therein, how one sensation differs from another with

hood,a reality). Now every sensation has a degree or magnitude, 
through which it can more or less fill the same time, i.e., the inner sense 
in regard to the same representation of an object, until it ceases in nothingness 
(= 0 = negatio). Hence there is a relationb and connection between, 
or rather a transition from reality to negation, that makes every BI83 
reality representable as a quantum, and the schema of a reality, as the 
quantity of something insofar as it fills time, is just this continuous and 
uniform generation of that quantity in time, as one descends in time 
from the sensation that has a certain degree to its disappearance or 
gradually ascends from negation to its magnitude. 

The schema of substance is the persistence of the real in time, i.e., the A 144 
representation of the real as a substratum of empirical time-determination 
in general, which therefore endures while everything else changes. 
(Time itself does not elapse, but the existence of that which is changeable 
elapses in it. To time, therefore, which is itself unchangeable and 
lasting, there corresponds in appearance that which is unchangeable in 
existence, i.e., substance, and in it alone can the succession and simultaneity 
of appearances be determined in regard to time.) 

The schema of the cause and of the causalityc of a thing in general is 
the real upon which, whenever it is posited, something else always follows. 
It therefore consists in the succession of the manifold insofar as it 
is subject to a rule. 

The schema of community (reciprocity), or of the reciprocal causality 
of substances with regard to their accidents, is the simultaneity of 
the determinations of the one with those of the other, in accordance B 184 
with a general rule. 

The schema of possibility is the agreement of the synthesis of various 
representations with the conditions of time in general (e.g., since opposites 
cannot exist in one thing at the same time, they can only exist 
one after another), thus the determination of the representation of a 
thing to some time. 

The schema of actualityd is existence at a determinate time. A 145 
The schema of necessity ise the existence of an object at all times.54 
N ow one sees from all this that the schema of each category contains 

and makes representable: in the case of magnitude, the generation (synthesis) 
of time itself, in the successive apprehension of an object; in the 
case of the schema of quality, the synthesis of sensation (perception) 
with the representation of time, or the filling of time; in the case of the

schema of relation,a the relationb of the perceptions among themselves 
to all time (i.e., in accordance with a rule of time-determination); finally, 
in the schema of modality and its categories, time itself, as the 
correlate of the determination of whether and how an object belongs to 
time. The schemata are therefore nothing but a priori time-determinations 
in accordance with rules, and these concern, according to the 
order of the categories, the time-series, the content of time, the 
order of time, and finally the sum total of timec in regard to all possible 
objects. 

From this it is clear that the schematism of the understanding 
through the transcendental synthesis of imagination comes down to 
nothing other than the unity of all the manifold of intuition in inner 
sense, and thus indirectly to the unity of apperception, as the function 
that corresponds to inner sense (to a receptivity). Thus the schemata of 
the concepts of pure understanding are the true and sole conditions for 
providing them with a relation to objects/ thus with significance, and 
hence the categories are in the end of none but a possible empirical use, 
since they merely serve to subject appearances to general rules of synthesis 
through grounds of an a priori necessary unity (on account of the 
necessary unification of all consciousness in an original apperception), 
and thereby to make them fit for a thoroughgoing connection in one 
experience. 

All of our cognitions, however, lie in the entirety of all possible experience, 
and transcendental truth, which precedes all empirical truth 
and makes it possible, consists in the general relation to this. 

But it is also obvious that, although the schemata of sensibility first 
realize the categories, yet they likewise also restrict them, i.e., limit 
them to conditions that lie outside the understanding (namely, in sensibility). 
Hence the schema is really only the phenomenon, or the sensible 
concept of an object, in agreement with the category. (Numerus est 
quantitas phaenomenon, sensatio realitas phaenomenon, constans et perdurabile 
rerum substantia phaenomenon -aeternitas, necessitas phaenomena 
etc.).e Now if we leave aside a restricting condition, it may seem as if we 
amplify the previously limited concept; thus the categories in their pure 
significance, without any conditions of sensibility, should hold for 
things in general, as they are, instead of their schemata merely representing 
them how they appear, and they would therefore have a sig

nificance independent of all schemata and extending far beyond them. 
In fact, even after abstraction from all sensible condition, significance, 
but only a logical significance of the mere unity of representations, is 
left to the pure concepts of the understanding, but no object and thus 
no significance is given to them that could yield a concepta of the object.
b Thus, e.g., if one leaves out the sensible determination of persistence, 
substance would signify nothing more than a something that can 
be thought as a subject (without being a predicate of something else). 
Now out of this representation I can make nothing, as it shows me 
nothing at all about what determinations the thing that is to count as B 187 
such a first subject is to have. Without schemata, therefore, the categories 
are only functions of the understanding for concepts, but do not 
represent any object. This significance comes to them from sensibility, 
which realizes the understanding at the same time as it restricts it.

Transcendental Doctrine of the 
Power of Judgment 
(or Analytic of Principles) 
Second Chapter 
System of aU principles of pure 
understanding 
In the previous chapter we have considered the transcendental power 
of judgment only in accordance with the general conditions under 
which alone it is authorized to use the pure concepts of the understanding 
for synthetic judgments. Now our task is to exhibit in systematic 
combination the judgments that the understanding actually 
brings about a priori subject to this critical warning, for which our table 
of the categories must doubtless give us natural and secure guidance. 
For it is precisely these whose relation to possible experience must 
constitute all pure cognition of the understanding a priori, and whose 
relationa to sensibility in general will, on that very account, display all 

B 188 transcendental principles of the use of the understanding completely 
and in a system. 
A priori principles bear this name not merely because they contain in 
themselves the grounds of other judgments, but also because they are 
not themselves grounded in higher and more general cognitions. Yet 

A 149 this property does not elevate them beyond all proof. For although this 
could not be carried further objectively, but rather grounds all cognition 
of its object,b yet this does not prevent a proof from the subjective 
sources of the possibility of a cognition of an object in general from 
being possible, indeed even necessary, since otherwise the proposition 
would raise the greatest suspicion of being a merely surreptitious 
assertion. 
Second, we will limit ourselves merely to those principles that are re

lated to the categories. The principlesfl of the transcendental aesthetic, 
therefore, according to which space and time are the conditions of the 
possibility of all things as appearances, as well as the restriction of these 
principles, namely that they cannot be related to things in themselves, 
do not belong within our confined field of investigation. Likewise the 
mathematical principles do not constitute any part of this system, since 
they are drawn only from intuition, not from the pure concept of the 
understanding; yet their possibility, since they are likewise synthetic a B 189 
priori judgments, necessarily finds a place here, not in order to prove 
their correctness and apodictic certainty, which is not at all necessary, 
but only to make comprehensible and to deduce the possibility of such 
evident cognitions a priori. 

But we must also speak of the principle of analytic judgments, in contrast, 
to be sure, to that of synthetic judgments, with which we are prop-AI 50 
erly concerned, since precisely this contrast will free the theory of the 
latter from all misunderstanding and lay their particular nature clearly 
before our eyes. 


The System of the Principles of Pure Understanding 
First Section 

On the supreme principle 
of all analytic judgments.55 
Whatever the content of our cognition may be, and however it may be 
related to the object,b the general though to be sure only negative condition 
of all of our judgments whatsoever is that they do not contradict 
themselves; otherwise these judgments in themselves (even without regard 
to the objecty are nothing. But even if there is no contradiction B 190 
within our judgment, it can nevertheless combine concepts in a way not 
entailed by the object, or even without any ground being given to us either 
a priori or a posteriori that would justify such a judgment, and thus, 
for all that a judgment may be free of any internal contradiction, it can 
still be either false or groundless. 

Now the proposition that no predicate pertains to a thing that con-AI51 
tradicts it is called the principled of contradiction, and is a general 
though merely negative criterion of all truth, but on that account it also 
belongs merely to logic, since it holds of cognitions merely as cogni

tions in general, without regard to their content, and says that contradiction 
entirely annihilates and cancels them. 

But one can also make a positive use of it, i.e., not merely to ban falsehood 
and error (insofar as it rests on contradiction), but also to cognize 
truth. For, if the judgment is analytic, whether it be negative or affirmative, 
its truth must always be able to be cognized sufficiently in accordance 
with the principle of contradiction. For the contrary of that 
which as a concept already lies and is thought in the cognition of the 
objecta is always correctly denied, while the concept itself must necessarily 
be affirmed of it, since its opposite would contradict the object.b 

Hence we must also allow the principle of contradiction to count 
as the universal and completely sufficient principle' of all analytic 
cognition; but its authority and usefulness does not extend beyond this, 
as a sufficient criterion of truth. For that no cognition can be opposed 
to it without annihilating itself certainly makes this principled into a con-

AI 52 ditio sine qua non, but not into a determining ground of the truth of our 
cognition. Since we now really have to do only with the synthetic part 
of our cognition, we will, to be sure, always be careful not to act contrary 
to this inviolable principle, but we cannot expect any advice from 
it in regard to the truth of this sort of cognition. 
There is, however, still one formula of this famous principle, although 
denuded of all content and merely formal, which contains a synthesis 
that is incautiously and entirely unnecessarily mixed into it. This 
is: "It is impossible for something to be and not to be at the same 
time." In addition to the fact that apodictic certainty is superfluously 
appended to this (by means of the word "impossible"), which must yet 
be understood from the proposition itself, the proposition is affected by 

B 192 the condition of time, and as it were says: "A thing = A, which is something 
= B, cannot at the same time be non-B, although it can easily be 
both (B as well as non-B) in succession." E.g., a person who is young 
cannot be old at the same time, but one and the same person can very 
well be young at one time and not young, i.e., old, at another. Now the 
principle of contradiction, as a merely logical principle, must not limit 

AI53 its claims to temporal relations.' Hence such a formula is entirely contrary 
to its aim. The misunderstanding results merely from our first abstracting 
a predicate of a thing from its concept and subsequently 
connecting its opposite with this predicate, which never yields a contradiction 
with the subject, but only with the predicate that is combined 
with it synthetically, and indeed only when both the first and the sec

ond predicate are affirmed at the same time. If I say "A person who is 
unlearned is not learned," the condition at the same time must hold; 
for one who is unlearned at one time can very well be learned at another 
time. But if I say that "No unlearned person is learned," then the 
proposition is analytic, since the mark (of unlearnedness) is now comprised 
in the concept of the subject, and then the negative proposition 
follows immediately from the principle of contradiction, without the 
condition at the same time having to be added. This is also then the 
cause why I have above so altered the formula of it that the nature of an B 193 
analytic proposition is thereby clearly expressed. 

Of the System of the Principles of Pure Understanding A 154 
Second Section 

On the supreme principle of all synthetic judgments.56 

The explanation of the possibility of synthetic judgments is a problem 
with which general logic has nothing to do, indeed whose name it need 
not even know. But in a transcendental logic it is the most important 
business of all, and indeed the only business if the issue is the possibility 
of synthetic a priori judgments and likewise the conditions and the 
domain of their validity. For by completing this task transcendental 
logic can fully satisfy its goal of determining the domain and boundaries 
of pure understanding. 

In the analytic judgment I remain with the given concept in order to 
discern something about it. If it is an affirmative judgment, I only ascribe 
to this concept that which is already thought in it; if it is a negative 
judgment, I only exclude the opposite of this concept from it. In 
synthetic judgments, however, I am to go beyond the given concept in 
order to consider something entirely different from what is thought in 
it as in a relation° to it, a relationb which is therefore never one of either B194 
identity, or contradiction, and one where neither the truth nor the error A155 
of the judgment can be seen in the judgment itself. 

If it is thus conceded that one must go beyond a given concept in 
order to compare it synthetically with another, then a third thing is necessary 
in which alone the synthesis of two concepts can originate. But 
now what is this third thing, as the medium of all synthetic judgments? 
There is only one totalityc in which all of our representations are contained, 
namely inner sense and its a priori form, time. The synthesis of 
representations rests on the imagination, but their synthetic unity 
(which is requisite for judgment), on the unity of apperception. Herein

therefore is the possibility of synthetic judgments, and, since all three 
contain the sources of a priori representations, also the possibility of 
pure synthetic judgments, to be sought, indeed on these grounds they 
will even be necessary if a cognition of objects is to come about which 
rests solely on the synthesis of the representations. 

If a cognition is to have objective reality, i.e., to be related to an object, 
and is to have significance and sense in that object, the object must 
be able to be given in some way. Without that the concepts are empty, 
and through them one has, to be sure, thought but not in fact cognized 
anything through this thinking, but rather merely played with representations. 
To give an object, if this is not again meant only mediately, 
but it is rather to be exhibited immediately in intuition, is nothing other 
than to relate its representation to experience (whether this be actual or 
still possible). Even space and time, as pure as these concepts are from 
everything empirical and as certain as it is that they are represented in 
the mind completely a priori, would still be without objective validity 
and without sense and significance if their necessary use on the objects 
of experience were not shown; indeed, their representation is a mere 
schema, which is always related to the reproductive imagination that 
calls forth the objects of experience, without which they would have no 
significance; and thus it is with all concepts without distinction. 

The possibility of experience is therefore that which gives all of our 
cognitions a priori objective reality. Now experience rests on the synthetic 
unity of appearances, i.e., on a synthesis according to concepts of 
the object of appearances in general, without which it would not even 
be cognition but rather a rhapsody of perceptions, which would not fit 
together in any context in accordance with rules of a thoroughly connected 
(possible) consciousness, thus not into the transcendental and 
necessary unity of apperception. Experience therefore has principles a of 
its form which ground it a priori, namely general rules of unity in the 
synthesis of appearances, whose objective reality, as necessary conditions, 
can always be shown in experience, indeed in its possibility. But 
apart from this relation synthetic a priori propositions are entirely impossible, 
since they would then have no third thing, namely a pure object,
b in which the synthetic unity of their concepts could establish 
objective reality. 

Thus although in synthetic judgments we cognize a priori so much 
about space in general or about the shapes that the productive imagination 
draws in it that we really do not need any experience for this, still 
this cognition would be nothing at all, but an occupation with a mere 
figment of the brain, if space were not to be regarded as the condition

b reinen Gegenstand; Erdmann suggests keinem Gegenstand, i.e., "no object." 

282 



Section III. Systematic representation of all synthetic principles 

of the appearances which constitute the matter of outer experience; 
hence those pure synthetic judgments are related, although only mediately, 
to possible experience, or rather to its possibility itself, and on 
that alone is the objective validity of their synthesis grounded. 

Thus since experience, as empirical synthesis, is in its possibility the 
only kind of cognition that gives all other synthesis reality, as a priori 
cognition it also possesses truth (agreement with the object)O only inso-B 197 
far as it contains nothing more than what is necessary for the synthetic 
unity of experience in general. AI58 

The supreme principleb of all synthetic judgments is, therefore: Every 
object stands under the necessaty conditions of the synthetic unity of the 
manifold of intuition in a possible experience. 

In this way synthetic a priori judgments are possible, if we relate the 
formal conditions of a priori intuition, the synthesis of the imagination, 
and its necessary unity in a transcendental apperception to a possible 
cognition of experience in general, and say: The conditions of the possibility 
of experience in general are at the same time conditions of the 
possibility of the objects of experience, and on this account have objective 
validity in a synthetic judgment a priori.' 

Of the System of the Principles of Pure Understanding 
Third Section 


Systematic representation of all synthetic 
principles of pure understanding. 

That there are principles anywhere at all is to be ascribed solely to the 
pure understanding, which is not only the faculty of rules in regard to B 198 
that which happens, but is rather itself the source of the principles in 
accordance with which everything (that can even come before us as an A 159 
object) necessarily stands under rules, since, without such rules, appearances 
could never amount to cognition of an object corresponding 
to them. Even laws of nature, if they are considered as principles of the 
empirical use of the understanding, at the same time carry with them an 
expression of necessity, thus at least the presumption of determination 
by grounds that are a priori and valid prior to all experience.57 But with

C The following two notes are entered in Kant's copy at A 158: 
"How are the objects determined in accordance with the concept a priori?" (E LXII, 
p. 28; 23:28) 
"The [principles] can never be proved from mere concepts, as if they dealt with 
things in themselves, but can only be proved from the possibility of the perception of 
things." (E LXIII, p. 29; 2p8) 

283

AI60 
Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. I. Bk. II. Ch. II 

out exception all laws of nature stand under higher principles of the understanding, 
as they only apply the latter to particular cases of appearance. 
Thus these higher principles alone provide the concept, which 
contains the condition and as it were the exponents for a rule in general, 
while experience provides the case which stands under the rule. 

There can really be no danger that one will regard merely empirical 
principles as principles of the pure understanding, or vice versa; for the 
necessity according to concepts that distinguishes the latter, and whose 
lack in every empirical proposition, no matter how generally it may hold, 
is easily perceived, can easily prevent this confusion. There are, however, 
pure principles a priori that I may nevertheless not properly ascribe to 
the pure understanding, since they are not derived from pure concepts 
but rather from pure intuitions (although by means of the understanding); 
the understanding, however, is the faculty of concepts. Mathematics 
has principles of this sort, but their application to experience, 
thus their objective validity, indeed the possibility of such synthetic a priori 
cognition (its deduction) still always rests on the pure understanding. 

Hence I will not count among my principles those of mathematics, 
but I will include those on which the possibility and objective a priori 
validity of the latter are grounded, and which are thus to be regarded as 
the principle of these principles,a and that proceed from concepts to 
the intuition but not from the intuition to concepts. 

In the application of the pure concepts of understanding to possible 
experience the use of their synthesis is either mathematical58 or dynamical: 
for it pertains partly merely to the intuition, partly to the existence 
of an appearance in general. The a priori conditions of intuition, 
however, are necessary throughout in regard to a possible experience, 
while those of the existence of the objectsb of a possible empirical intuition 
are in themselves only contingent. Hence the principles of the 
mathematical use will be unconditionally necessary, i.e., apodictic, while 
the principles of the dynamical use, to be sure, also carry with them the 
character of an a priori necessity, but only under the condition of empirical 
thinking in an experience, thus only mediately and indirectly; 

B200 consequently these do not contain the immediate evidence that is characteristic 
of the former (though their universal certainty in relation to 
experience is not thereby injured). Yet this will be better judged at the 
conclusion of this system of principles. 
The table of categories gives us entirely natural direction for the 
table of principles, since these principles are nothing other than rules of 


a als Principium dieser Grundsdtze, i.e., as the general principle giving objective validity to 
the propositions of mathematics which are themselves synthetic a priori according to the 
"Transcendental Aesthetic."

of the homogeneous in everything that can be considered mathematically 
(which synthesis can be further divided into that of aggregation and of coalition, 
of which the first is directed to extensive magnitudes and the second to 
intensive magnitudes). The second combination (nexus) is the synthesis of that 
which is manifold insofar as they necessarily belong to one another, as e.g., 
an accident belongs to some substance, or the effect to the cause -thus also as 
represented as unhomogeneous but yet as combined apriori, which combination, 
since it is not arbitrary, I call dynamical, since it concerns the combination 
of the existence of the manifold (which can again be divided into the 

B202 physical combination of the appearances with one another and the metaphysical, 
their combination in the apriori faculty of cognition).>

through the synthesis of the manifold through which the representations 
of a determinate space or time are generated, i.e., through the 
composition of that which is homogeneous a and the consciousness of 
the synthetic unity of this manifold (of the homogeneous). Now the B 203

the concept of a magnitude, i.e., the appearances are all magnitudes, 
and indeed extensive magnitudes, since as intuitions in space or time 
they must be represented through the same synthesis as that through 
which space and time in general are determined.> 

I call an extensive magnitude that in which the representation of the A 162 
parts makes possible the representation of the whole (and therefore 
necessarily precedes the latter).62 I cannot represent to myself any line, 
no matter how small it may be, without drawing it in thought, i.e., successively 
generating all its parts from one point, and thereby first 
sketching this intuition. It is exactly the same with even the smallest AI63 
time. I think therein only the successive progress from one moment to 
another, where through all parts of time and their addition a determi


of quantity, while Griffie as quantum refers to "eine Griffie in concreto" (pp. 298, 300). 
This distinction can be marked in English as that between "quantity" and "magnitude." 
However, we will follow our practice in earlier sections, using "magnitude" as the translation 
of Grofe and reserving "quantity" for Quantitiit. 

d The following notes are inserted in Kant's copy of the first edition at the start of this 
section: 

"One must subsume the perceptions under the categories. But one can infer nothing 
from those categories themselves, but only from the possibility of perception, which 
can only happen through the determination of time and in time, in which the act [Actus] 
that determines the intuition is possible only in accordance with a category." (E LXVI, 
p. 29; 23:28) 

"Since we can all arrange perceptions only through apprehension in time, but this is 
a synthesis of the homogeneous, which the concept of magnitude corresponds to in the 
unity of consciousness, we cannot cognize the objects of outer and inner sense otherwise 
than as magnitudes in experience. Limitation of the concept of magnitude." (E 
LXVII, p. 30; 23=28-9) 

, The heading "Proof" and the following paragraph were added in the second edition.

units"; see the expression Gleichartigen (der Einheiten) at A I 64/B 205 below.

nate magnitude of time is finally generated.a Since the mere intuition in 
all appearances is either space or time, every appearance as intuition is 
an extensive magnitude, as it can only be cognized through successive 
synthesis (from part to part) in apprehension. All appearances are accordingly 
already intuited as aggregates (multitudes of antecedently 
given parts),b which is not the case with every kind of magnitude, but 
rather only with those that are represented and apprehended by us as 

extensive.' 

On this successive synthesis of the productive imagination, in the 
generation of shapes, is grounded the mathematics of extension (geometry) 
with its axioms, which express the conditions of sensible intuition 
a priori, under which alone the schema of a pure concept of outer appearance 
can come about; e.g., between two points only one straight 
line is possible; two straight lines do not enclose a space, etc. These are 
the axioms that properly concern only magnitudes (quanta) as such. 

But concerning magnitude (quantitas), i.e., the answer to the question 
"How big is something?", although various of these propositions 
AI64 are synthetic and immediately certain (indemonstrabilia), there are nevertheless 
no axioms in the proper sense. For that equals added to or 
subtracted from equals give an equal are analytic propositions, since I 
B 205 am immediately conscious of the identity of one generation of a magnitude 
with the other; but axioms ought to be synthetic a priori propositions. 
The self-evident propositions of numerical relation,d on the 
contrary, are to be sure, synthetic, but not general, like those of geometry, 
and for that reason also cannot be called axioms, but could rather 
be named numerical formulas. That 7 + 5 = 12 is not an analytic proposition. 
For I do not think the number 12 either in the representation 
of 7 nor in that of 5 nor in the representation of the combinatione of 
the two (that I ought to think this in the addition of the two is not 
here at issue; in the case of an analytic proposition the question is only

Inserted in Kant's copy of the first edition: "Hence the concept of an extensive magnitude 
does not pertain merely to that wherein there is extension, i.e., merely to our intuition. 
Satisfaction has extensive magnitude in accordance with the length of the time 
that is agreeably spent, although it also has magnitude intensive [intensively] according 
to the degree of this agreeableness." (E LXVIII, p. 30; 23:29)

concepts of magnitude." (E LXX, p. 30; 23:29)

Section III. Systematic representation of all synthetic principles 

whether I actually think the predicate in the representation of the subject). 
Although it is synthetic, however, it is still only a singular proposition. 
Insofar as it is only the synthesis of that which is homogeneous 
(of units) that is at issue here, the synthesis here can take place only in 
a single way, even though the subsequent use of these numbers is general. 
If I say: "With three lines, two of which taken together are greater 
than the third, a triangle can be drawn," then I have here the mere 
function of the productive imagination, which draws the lines greater 

or smaller, thus allowing them to abut at any arbitrary angle. The A I65 

number 7/ on the contrary, is possible in only a single way, and like


wise the number I2, which is generated through the synthesis of the 

former with 5. Such propositions must therefore not be called axioms 

(for otherwise there would be infinitely many of them) but rather nu-B 206 

merical formulas. 
This transcendental principle of the mathematics of appearances 
yields a great expansion of our a priori cognition. For it is this alone that 
makes pure mathematics in its complete precision applicable to objects 
of experience, which without this principle would not be so obvious, 
and has indeed caused much contradiction. Appearances are not things 
in themselves. Empirical intuition is possible only through the pure intuition 
(of space and time); what geometry says about the latter is therefore 
undeniably valid of the former, and evasions, as if objects of the 
senses did not have to be in agreement with the rules of construction in 
space (e.g., the rules of the infinite divisibility of lines or angles), must 
cease. For one would thereby deny all objective validity to space, and 
with it at the same time to all mathematics, and would no longer know 
why and how far they are to be applied to appearances. The synthesis 
of spaces and times, as the essential form of all intuition, is that which 
at the same time makes possible the apprehension of the appearance, 
thus every outer experience, consequently also all cognition of its ob-A I66 
jects, and what mathematics in its pure use proves about the former is 
also necessarily valid for the latter. All objections to this are only the 
chicanery of a falsely instructed reason, which erroneously thinks of B 207 
freeing the objects of the senses from the formal condition of our sensibility, 
and, though they are mere appearances, represents them as objects

<Anticipations of Perception.>a 

[In the first edition:] 

The principle, which anticipates all perceptions, as such, 
runs thus: In all appearances the sensation, and the real, 
which corresponds to it in the obiect (realitas 
phaenomenon), has an intensive magnitude, i.e., a degree. 


[In the second edition:] 

<Its principleb is: In all appearances the real, which is an object 
of the sensation, has intensive magnitude, i.e., a degree.>63 

«Proof 

Perception is empirical consciousness, i.e., one in which there is at the 
same time sensation. Appearances, as objects of perception, are not 
pure (merely formal) intuitions, like space and time (for these cannot be 
perceived in themselves). They therefore also contain in addition to the 
intuition the materials for some object! in general (through which 
something existing in space or time is represented), i.e., the real of the 
sensation, as merely subjective representation, by which one can only 
be conscious that the subject is affected, and which one relates to an ob-

B 208 ject' in general. Now from the empirical consciousness to the pure consciousness 
a gradual alteration is possible, where the real in the former 
entirely disappears, and a merely formal (a priort) consciousness of the 
manifold in space and time remains;64 thus there is also possible a synthesis 
of the generation of the magnitude of a sensation from its beginning, 
the pure intuition 0, to any arbitrary magnitude. Now since== 
sensation in itself is not an objective representation, and in it neither 
the intuition of space nor that of time is to be encountered, it has, to be 
sure, no extensive magnitude, but yet it still has a magnitude (and indeed 
through its apprehension, in which the empirical consciousness 
can grow in a certain time from nothing == ° to its given measure), thus 
it has an intensive magnitude, corresponding to which all objects! of 
perception, insofar as they contain sensation, must be ascribed an intensive 
magnitude, i.e., a degree of influence on sense.>

Section III. Systematic representation of all synthetic principles 

without doubt this is the significance with which Epicurus used his ex-AI67 
pression 'iTpOA llt\JL<;. 65 But since there is something in the appearances 
that is never cognized a priori, and which hence also constitutes the real 
difference between empirical and a priori cognition, namely the sensation 
(as matter of perception), it follows that it is really this that cannot B209 
be anticipated at all. On the contrary, we would call the pure determinations 
in space and time, in regard to shape as well as magnitude, anticipations 
of appearances, since they represent a priori that which may 
always be given a posteriori in experience. But if it were supposed that 
there is something which can be cognized a priori in every sensation, as 
sensation in general (without a particular one being given), then this 
would deserve to be called an anticipation in an unusual sense, since it 
seems strange to anticipate experience precisely in what concerns its 
matter, which one can draw out of it. And this is actually how things 
stand. 

Apprehension, merely by means of sensation, fills only an instant (if I 
do not take into consideration the succession of many sensations). As 
something in the appearance, the apprehension of which is not a successive 
synthesis, proceeding from the parts to the whole representation, it 
therefore has no extensive magnitude; the absence of sensation in the 
same moment would represent this as empty, thus = o. Now that in the AI68 
empirical intuition which corresponds to the sensation is reality (realitas 
phaenomenon); that which corresponds to its absence is negation = 

o. 

Now, however, every sensation is capable of a diminution, so that it can B 2 10 
decrease and thus gradually disappear.66 Hence between reality in appearance 
and negation there is a continuous nexus of many possible intermediate 
sensations, whose difference from one another is always 
smaller than the difference between the given one and zero, or complete 
negation. That is, the real in appearance always has a magnitude, which 
is not, however, encountered in apprehension, as this takes place by 
means of the mere sensation in an instant and not through successive 
synthesis of many sensations, and thus does not proceed from the parts 
to the whole; it therefore has a magnitude, but not an extensive one. 

Now I call that magnitude which can only be apprehended as a unity, 
and in which multiplicity can only be represented through approximation 
to negation = 0, intensive magnitude. Thus every reality in the 
appearance has intensive magnitude, i.e., a degree. If one regards this 
reality as cause (whether of the sensation or of another reality in appearance, 
e.g., an alteration), then one calls the degree of reality as 
cause a "moment," e.g., the moment of gravity, because, indeed, the degree 
designates only that magnitude the apprehension of which is not A 169 
successive but instantaneous. But I touch on this here only in passing, 
for at present I am not yet dealing with causality. 

Accordingly every sensation, thus also every reality in appear-B 2 I I 

291 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. I. Bk. II. Ch. II 

ance,a however small it may be, has a degree, i.e., an intensive magnitude, 
which can still always be diminished, and between reality and 
negation there is a continuous nexus of possible realities, and of possible 
smaller perceptions. Every color, e.g., red, has a degree, which, 
however small it may be, is never the smallest, and it is the same with 
warmth, with the moment of gravity, etc. 


The property of magnitudes on account of which no part of them is 
the smallest (no part is simple) is called their continuity. Space and time 
are quanta continua, b because no part of them can be given except as enclosed 
between boundaries (points and instants), thus only in such a way 
that this part is again a space or a time. Space therefore consists only of 
spaces, time of times. Points and instants are only boundaries, i.e., mere 
places of their limitation; but places always presuppose those intuitions 
that limit or determine them, and from mere places, as components that 

AI70 could be given prior to space or time, neither space nor time can be 
composed. Magnitudes of this sort can also be called flowing, since the 
synthesis (of the productive imagination) in their generation is a 

B 2 I 2 progress in time, the continuity of which is customarily designated by 
the expression "flowing" ("elapsing"). 

All appearances whatsoever are accordingly continuous magnitudes, 
either in their intuition, as extensive magnitudes, or in their mere perception 
(sensation and thus reality), as intensive ones. If the synthesis of 
the manifold of appearance is interrupted, then it is an aggregate of many 
appearances, and not really appearance as a quantum, which is not generated 
through the mere continuation of productive synthesis of a certain 
kind, but through the repetition of an ever-ceasing synthesis. If! call thirteen 
dollars a quantum of money, I do so correctly insofar as I mean by 
that an amount of a mark of fine silver, which is to be sure a continuous 
magnitude, in which no part is the smallest but each part could constitute 
a coin that would always contain material for still smaller ones. But if by 
the term "thirteen round dollars" I mean so many coins (whatever their 
amount of silver might be), then it would not be suitable to call this a 
quantum of dollars, but it must instead be called an aggregate, i.e., a numAI71 
ber of coins. Now since there must still be a unity grounding every number, 
appearance as unity is a quantum, and is as such always a continuum. 
Now if all appearances, considered extensively as well as intensively, are 
continuous magnitudes, then the proposition that all alteration' (transi

tion of a thing from one state into another) is also continuous could be B 2 I 3 
proved here easily and with mathematical self-evidence, if the causality of 
an alteration in general did not lie entirely beyond the boundaries of a 
transcendental philosophy and presuppose empirical principles.a For the 
understanding gives us no inkling a priori that a cause is possible which 
alters the state of things, i.e., determines them to the opposite of a certain 

given state, not merely because it simply does not give us insight into the 
possibility of this (for this insight is lacking in many a priori cognitions), 
but rather because alterability concerns only certain determinations of 
appearances, about which experience alone can teach us, while their cause 


is to be found in the unalterable. But since we have before us here nothing 
that we can use except the pure fundamental concepts of all possible 
experience, in which there must be nothing at all empirical, we cannot 
anticipate general natural science, which is built upon certain fundamental 
experiences, without injuring the unity of the system. A I72 

Nevertheless, we are not lacking proofs of the great influence that 
our principle has in anticipating perceptions, and even in making good 
their absence insofar as it draws the bolt against all the false inferences 
that might be drawn from that. 

If all reality in perception has a degree, between which and negation B 2 I4 
there is an infinite gradation of ever lesser degrees, and if likewise every 
sense must have a determinate degree of receptivity for the sensations, 
then no perception, hence also no experience, is possible that, whether 
immediately or mediately (through whatever detour in inference one 
might want), would prove an entire absence of everything real in appearance, 
i.e., a proof of empty space or of empty time can never be 
drawn from experience. For, first, the entire absence of the real in sensible 
intuition cannot itself be perceived, and, second, it cannot be deduced 
from any single appearance and the difference in the degree of its 
reality, nor may it ever be assumed for the explanation of that. For even 
if the entire intuition of a determinate space or time is real through and 
through, i.e., no part of it is empty, yet, since every reality has its degree 
that can decrease to nothing (emptiness) through infinite steps while the A I 73 
extensive magnitude of the appearance remains unaltered, it must yield 
infinitely different degrees with which space or time is filled, and the intensive 
magnitude in different appearances can be smaller or greater 
even though the extensive magnitude of the intuition remains identical. 

We will give an example of this. Nearly all natural philosophers,b since B 2 I 5 
they perceive a great difference in the quantity of matter of different 
sorts in the same volumes (partly through the moment of gravity, or 
weight, partly through the moment of resistance against other, moved 


a Principien 
h Naturlehrer 


293 



Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. I. Bk. II. Ch. II 

matter), unanimously infer from this that this volume (extensive magnitude 
of the appearance) must be empty in all matter, although to be sure 
in different amounts. But who among these for the most part mathematical 
and mechanical students of nature ever realized that their inference 
rested solely on a metaphysical presupposition, which they make so 
much pretense of avoiding? -for they assume that the real in space (l 
cannot call it here impenetrability or weight, since these are empirical 
concepts), is everywhere one and the same, and can be differentiated 
only according to its extensive magnitude, i.e., amount.a Against this 
presupposition, for which they can have no ground in experience and 
which is therefore merely metaphysical, I oppose a transcendental proof, 
A174 which, to be sure, will not explain the variation in the filling of space, but 
which still will entirely obviate the alleged necessity of the presupposition 
that the difference in question cannot be explained except by the assumption 
of empty spaces, and which has the merit of at least granting 
the understanding the freedom also to think of this difference in another 
B 2 16 way, if the explanation of nature should make some hypothesis necessary 
for this end. For there we see that, although equal spaces can be completely 
filled with different matters in such a way that in neither of them 
is there a point in which the presence of matter is not to be encountered, 
nevertheless everything real has for the same quality its degree (of resistance 
or of weight) which, without diminution of the extensive magnitude 
or amount/ can become infinitely smaller until it is transformed 
into emptiness and disappears. Thus an expansion that fills a space, e.g. 
warmth, and likewise every other reality (in appearance) can, without in 
the least leaving the smallest part of this space empty, decrease in degree 
infinitely, and nonetheless fill the space with this smaller degree just as 
well as another appearance does with a larger one. My aim here is by no 
means to assert that this is how it really is concerning the specific gravity 
of the variety of matters, but only to establish, on the basis of a prin-

A 175 ciple of pure understanding, that the nature of our perceptions makes an 
explanation of this sort possible, and that it is false to assume that the real 
in appearance is always equal in degree and differs only in aggregation 
and its extensive magnitude, especially when this is allegedly asserted on 
the basis of a principle of understanding a priori. 

B217 Nevertheless there must always be something striking about this anticipation 
of perception for a researcher who has become accustomed to 
transcendental consideration and thereby become cautious, and some 
reservation is aroused about the fact that the understanding can anticipate 
a synthetic proposition of the sort which that concerning the degree 
of everything real in appearance is, and thus about the possibility

Section III. Systematic representation of all synthetic principles 

of the inner variation of the sensation itself if one abstracts from its empirical 
quality, and it is therefore a question not unworthy of solution, 
how the understanding can assert something synthetic a priori about appearances, 
and indeed anticipate them in that which is really merely 
empirical, namely what pertains to sensation. 

The quality of sensation is always merely empirical and cannot be 
represented a priori at all (e.g. colors, taste, etc.). But the real, which corresponds 
to sensations in general, in opposition to the negation = 0, only 
represents something whose concept in itself contains a being, and does 
not signify anything except the synthesis in an empirical consciousness AI76 
in general. In inner sense, namely, the empirical consciousness can be 
raised from ° up to any greater degree, so that the very same extensive 
magnitude of intuition (e.g., an illuminated surface) can excite as great a 
sensation as an aggregate of many other (less illuminated) surfaces taken 
together. One can therefore abstract entirely from the extensive magnitude 
of appearance and yet represent in the mere sensation in one mo-B 2 18 
ment a synthesis of uniform increase from ° up to the given empirical 
consciousness. All sensations are thus, as such, given only a posteriori,a 
but their property of having a degree can be cognized a priori. It is remarkable 
that we can cognize a priori of all magnitudes in general only a 
single quality,namely continuity, but that in all quality (the real of appearances) 
we can cognize a priori nothing more than their intensive 
quantity/namely that they have a degree, and everything else is left to 
expenence.

which is not itself contained in perception but contains the synthetic 
unity of the manifold of perception in one consciousness, which constitutes 
what is essential in a cognition of objects a of the senses, i.e., of ex-

B 2 19 perience (not merely of the intuition or sensation of the senses). Now in 
experience, to be sure, perceptions come together only contingently, so 
that no necessity of their connection is or can become evident in the perceptions 
themselves, since apprehension is only a juxtapositionb of the 
manifold of empirical intuition, but no representation of the necessity of 
the combined existence of the appearances that it juxtaposes in space and 
time is to be encountered in it. But since experience is a cognition of objectsC 
through perception, consequently the relationd in the existence of 
the manifold is to be represented in it not as it is juxtaposed in time but 
as it is objectively in time, yet since time itself cannot be perceived, the 
determination of the existence of objectse in time can only come about 
through their combination in time in general, hence only through a priori 
connecting concepts. Now since these always carry necessity along 
with them, experience is thus possible only through a representation of

Section III. Systematic representation of all synthetic principles 

to its form, i.e., the relation of the manifold empirical consciousness in 
time. Now in the original apperception all of this manifold, so far as its 
temporal relations are concerned, is to be unified; for this is what its 
transcendental unity, under which everything stands that is to belong to 
my (i.e., my united)a cognition, and thus can become an object for me, 
asserts a priori. This synthetic unity in the temporal relation of all perceptions, 
which is detennined a priori, is thus the law that all empirical 
time-determinations must stand under rules of general timedetermination, 
and the analogies of experience, with which we will now A 178 
deal, must be rules of this sort. 

These principles have the peculiarity that they do not concern the 
appearances and the synthesis of their empirical intuition, but merely 
their existence and their relation to one another with regard to this 
their existence. Now the way in which something is apprehended in ap-B 221 
pearance can be determined a priori so that the rule of its synthesis at 
the same time yields this intuition a priori in every empirical example, 
i.e., can bring the former about from the latter. Yet the existence of appearances 
cannot be cognized a priori, and even if we could succeed on 
this path in inferring to some existence or other, we still would not be 
able to cognize it determinately, i.e., be able to anticipate that through 
which its empirical intuition is differentiated from others. 

The preceding two principles, which I named the mathematical ones 
in consideration of the fact that they justified applying mathematics to 
appearances, pertained to appearances with regard to their mere possibility, 
and taught how both their intuition and the real in their perception 
could be generated in accordance with rules of a mathematical synthesis, 
hence how in both cases numerical magnitudes and, with them, 
the determination of the appearance as magnitude, could be used. E.g., 
I would be able to compose and determine a priori, i.e., construct the de-AI79 
gree of the sensation of sunlight out of about 200,000 illuminations from 
the moon. Thus we can call the former principles constitutive. 

Things must be entirely different with those principles that are to 
bring the existence of appearances under rules a pr·iori. For, since this existence 
cannot be constructed, these principles can concern only the re-B222 
lationb of existence, and can yield nothing but merely regulative principles.
c Here therefore neither axioms nor intuitions are to be thought of; 
rather, if a perception is given to us in a temporal relation to others (even 
though indeterminate), it cannot be said a priori which and how great 
this other perception is, but only how it is necessarily combined with the 
first, as regards its existence, in this modus of time. In philosophy analogies 
signify something very different from what they represent in mathe

b Verhdltnis 
, Principien

matics. In the latter they are formulas that assert the identity of two relations 
of magnitude,a and are always constitutive, so that if two members 
of the proportion are given the third is also thereby given, i.e., can be 
constructed. In philosophy, however, analogy is not the identity of two 
quantitative but of two qualitative relations, where from three given 
members I can cognize and give a priori only the relation to a fourth 
Al80 member but not this fourth member itself, although I have a rule for 
seeking it in experience and a mark for discovering it there. An analogy 
of experience will therefore be only a rule in accordance with which unity 
of experience is to arise from perceptions (not as a perception itself, as 
empirical intuition in general), and as a principle it will not be valid of the 
objects (of the appearances) constitutively but merely regulatively.68 

B 223 The very same thing will also hold for the postulates of empirical thinking 
in general, which together concern the synthesis of mere intuition (of 
the form of appearance), of perception (of its matter), and of experience 
(of the relation of these perceptions), namely that they are only regulative 
principles, and that they differ from the mathematical principles, 
which are constitutive, not, to be sure, in their certainty, which is established 
a priori in both cases, but yet in the manner of their evidence, i.e., 
with regard to their intuitiveness (thus also their demonstration). 
But what must be remembered about all synthetic principles and especially 
noted here is this: that these analogies have their sole significance 
and validity not as principles of the transcendental use of the 
understanding but merely as principles of its empirical use, hence they 

A 181 can be proven only as such; consequently the appearances must not be 
subsumed under the categories per se, but only under their schemata. 
For if the objects to which these principles were to be related were things 
in themselves, then it would be entirely impossible to cognize anything 
about them synthetically a priori. Now it is nothing but appearances 
whose complete cognition, to which in the end all a priori principles must 
come down to, is only possible experience, and consequently those principles 
can have as their goal nothing but the conditions of the unity of 


B 2 24 empirical cognition in the synthesis of the appearances; but these conditions 
are thought only in the schema of the pure concept of the understanding, 
and the category contains the function, unrestricted by any 
sensible condition, of their unity, as of a synthesis in general. These principles, 
therefore, justify us in compounding the appearances only in accord 
with an analogy with the logical and general unity of concepts, and 
hence in the principle itself we make use of the category, but in its execution 
(its application to appearances) we set its schema in its place, as 
the key to its use, or rather we set the latter alongside the former, as its 
restricting condition, under the name of its formula.

"In space all alteration is movement; for if there were something else in the relations

All appearances are in time, in which, as substratum (as persistent form

be represented. The time, therefore, in which all change of appearances

or simultaneity can be represented only as determinations of it. 
Now time cannot be perceived by itself. a Consequently it is in the objects

encountered that represents time in general and in which all change or 
simultaneity can be perceived in apprehension through the relation of 
the appearances to it. However, the substratum 'bf everything real, i.e., 
everything that belongs to the existenceb of things, is substance, of 
which everything that belongs to existence can be thought only as a determination. 
Consequently that which persists, in relation to which 
alone all temporal relations of appearances can be determined, is substance 
in the appearance, i.e., the real in the appearance, which as the 
substratum of all change always remains the same. Since this, therefore, 
cannot change in existence, its quantum in nature can also be neither 
increased nor diminished.> 

A182 Our apprehension of the manifold of appearance is always successive, 
and is therefore always changing. We can therefore never determine 
from this alone whether this manifold, as object of experience, is 
simultaneous or successive, if something does not ground it which always 
exists, i.e., something lasting and persisting, of which all change 

B 226 and simultaneity are nothing but so many ways (modi of time) in which 
that which persists exists. Only in that which persists, therefore, are 
temporal relations possible (for simultaneity and succession are the only 

A 183 relations in time), i.e., that which persists is the substratum of the empirical 
representation of time itself, by which alone all time-determination 
is possible. Persistence gives general expression to time as the 
constant correlate of all existence of appearances, all change and all accompaniment.' 
For change does not affect time itself, but only the appearances 
in time (just as simultaneity is not a modus for time itself, in 
which no parts are simultaneous but rather all succeed one another). If 
one were to ascribe such a succession to time itself, one would have to 
think yet another time in which this succession would be possible.d

Section III. Systematic representation of all synthetic principles 

Only through that which persists does existence in different parts of 
the temporal series acquire a magnitude, which one calls duration. 
For in mere sequence alone existence is always disappearing and beginning, 
and never has the least magnitude. Without that which persists 
there is therefore no temporal relation. Now time cannot be perceived 
in itself; thus this persisting thing in the appearances is the substratum 
of all time-determination, consequently also the condition of the possibility 
of all synthetic unity of perceptions, i.e., of experience, and in this 
persisting thing all existence and all change in time can only be re-B 227 
garded as a modus of the existencea of that which lasts and persists. 
Therefore in all appearances that which persists is the object itself, i.e., 
the substance (phaenomenon), but everything that changes or that can 
change belongs only to the way in which this substance or substances A 184 
exists, thus to their determinations. 

I find that at all times not merely the philosopher but even the common 
understanding has presupposed this persistence as a substratum of 
all change in the appearances, and has also always accepted it as indubitable, 
only the philosopher expresses himself somewhat more determinately 
in saying that in all alterations in the world the substance 
remains and only the accidents change. But I nowhere find even the attempt 
at a proof of this so obviously synthetic proposition, indeed it 
only rarely stands, as it deserves to, at the head of the pure and completely 
a priori laws of nature. In fact the proposition that substance persists 
is tautological. For only this persistence is the ground for our 
application of the category of substance to appearance, and one should 
have proved that in all appearances there is something that persists, of 
which that which changesb is nothing but the determination of its existence. 
But since such a proof can never be conducted dogmatically, i.e., 
from concepts, because it concerns a synthetic a priori proposition, and B 228 
it was never considered that such propositions are valid only in relation' 
to possible experience, hence that they can be proved only through a 

through something whose existence is not a series of successions, but which includes 
these in itself as its determinations, consequently per durabilitatem [through the durability] 
of substance. 

"This proof, like all synthetic ones, is proved only from the possibility of perception. 
It is valid where I cannot perceive substance outside of its alterations; but where I cannot 
perceive it except through these alterations themselves, it is not valid, and I can estimate 
its endurance and in general the time of its alteration only through outer things, 
as I, since I think, think my own existence; my persistence is therefore not proved." (E 
LXXXIII, pp. 32-3; 23:3 r) 

"No quantum of substance is possible in the soul. Hence also nothing that one could 
determine through any predicate and call persistent." (E Lxxxrv, P.32; 23;3 r)

A 185 deduction of the possibility of the latter, it is no wonder that it has, to 
be sure, grounded all experience (for one feels the need for it in empirical 
cognition), but has never been proved. 

A philosopher was asked: How much does the smoke weigh? He 
replied: If you take away from the weight of the wood that was burnt 
the weight of the ashes that are left over, you will have the weight of the 
smoke. He thus assumed as incontrovertible that even in fire the matter 
(substance) never disappears but rather only suffers an alteration in 
its form.a Likewise the proposition "Nothing comes from nothing" is 
only another consequence of the principle of persistence, or rather of 
the everlasting existence of the proper subject in the appearances. For 
if that in the appearance which one would call substance is to be the 
proper substratum of all time-determination, then all existence in the 
past as well as in future time must be able to be determined in it and it 
alone. Hence we can grant an appearance the name of substance only if 
we presuppose its existence at all time, which is not even perfectly expressed 
through the word "persistence" since this pertains more to fu-
B 229 ture time. Nevertheless the inner necessity of persisting is inseparably 
connected with the necessity of always having existed, and the expres-


A I 86 sion may therefore stand. Gigni de nihilo nihil, in nihilum nil posse reverti, b 
are two propositions which the ancients connected inseparably, and 
which are now sometimes separated only out of misunderstanding, because 
one imagines that they pertain to things in themselves, and that 
the former would be opposed to the dependence of the world on a 
supreme cause (even as far as its substance is concerned); but this worry 
is unnecessary, for here the issue is only appearances in the field of experience, 
the unity of which would never be possible if we were to allow 
new things (as far as their substance is concerned) to arise. For then 
everything would disappear that alone can represent the unity of time, 
namely the identity of the substratum in which alone all change has its 
thoroughgoing unity. This persistence is therefore nothing more than 
the way in which we represent the existence of things (in appearance). 
The determinations of a substance that are nothing other than particular 
ways for it to exist are called accidents. They are always real, since 
they concern the existence of the substance (negations are merely determinations 
that express the non-being of something in the substance). 


B230 Now if one ascribes a particular existence to this real in substance (e.g., 
motion, as an accident of matter), then this existence is called "inherence," 
in contrast to the existence of the substance, which is called "sub


AI87 sistence." Yet many misinterpretations arise from this, and it is more

Section III. Systematic representation of all synthetic principles 

precise and correct if one characterizes the accident only through the 
way in which the existence of a substance is positively determinedJo 
Nevertheless, thanks to the conditions of the logical use of our understanding, 
it is still unavoidable for us to abstract out, as it were, that 
which can change in the existence of a substance while the substance remains, 
and to consider it in relation to what is really persistent and fundamental;
a thus this category also stands under the title of relations, but 
more as their condition than as itself containing a relation. 

Now on this persistence there is also grounded a correction of the 
concept of alteration. Arising and perishing are not alterations of that 
which arises or perishes. Alteration is a way of existing that succeeds another 
way of existing of the very same object. Hence everything that is 
altered is lasting, and only its state changes.?' Thus since this change 
concerns only the determinations that can cease or begin, we can say, in 
an expression that seems somewhat paradoxical, that only what persists 
(the substance) is altered, while that which is changeableb does not suf-B 231 
fer any alteration but rather a change, since some determinations cease 
and others begin. 

Alteration can therefore be perceived only in substances, and arising A 188 
or perishing per se cannot be a possible perception unless it concerns 
merely a determination of that which persists, for it is this very thing 
that persists that makes possible the representation of the transition 
from one state into another, and from non-being into being, which can 
therefore be empirically cognized only as changing determinations of 
that which lastsY If you assume that something simply began to be, 
then you would have to have a point of time in which it did not exist. 
But what would you attach this to, if not to that which already exists? 
For an empty time that would precede is not an object of perception; 
but if you connect this origination to things that existed antecedently 
and which endure until that which arises, then the latter would be only 
a determination of the former, as that which persists. It is just the same 
with perishing: for this presupposes the empirical representation of a 
time at which there is no longer an appearance. 

Substances (in appearance) are the substrata of all time-determinations. 
The arising of some of them and the perishing of others would 
itself remove the sole condition of the empirical unity of time, and the 
appearances would then be related to two different times, in which ex-B 232 
istence flowed side by side, which is absurd. For there is only one time, 
in which all different times must not be placed simultaneously but only A 189 
one after another. 

Persistence is accordingly a necessary condition under which alone

appearances, as things or objects, are determinable in a possible experience. 
As to the empirical criterion of this necessary persistence and with 
it of the substantiality of appearances, however, what follows will give 
us the opportunity to note what is necessary.73

which it follows in accordance with a rule. 

[In the second edition:]

Proof 

<b(That all appearances of the temporal sequence are collectively only 
alterations, i.e., a successive being and not-being of the determinations 
of the substance that persists there, consequently that the being of the 
substance itself, which succeeds its not-being, or its not-being, which 
succeeds its being, in other words, that the arising or perishing of the 

B 233 substance does not occur, the previous principle has shown. This could 
also have been expressed thus: All change (succession) of appearances 
is only alteration; for the arising or perishing of substance are 
not alterations of it, since the concept of alteration presupposes one and 
the same subject as existing with two opposed determinations, and thus 
as persisting. -After this preliminary reminder the proof follows.) 

I perceive that appearances succeed one another, i.e., that a state of 
things exists at one time the opposite of which existed in the previous 
state. Thus I really connect two perceptions in time. Now connection 
is not the work of mere sense and intuition, but is here rather the product 
of a synthetic faculty of the imagination, which determines inner 
sense with regard to temporal relations. This, however, can combine 
the two states in question in two different ways, so that either one or 
the other precedes in time; for time cannot be perceived in itself, nor 
can what precedes and what follows in objectsC be as it were empirically 
determined in relationd to it. I am therefore only conscious that my

imagination places one state before and the other after, not that the one 
state precedes the other in the object;a or, in other words, through the B 234 
mere perception the objective relation of the appearances that are succeeding 
one another remains undetermined. Now in order for this to be 
cognized as determined, the relation between the two states must be 
thought in such a way that it is thereby necessarily determined which of 
them must be placed before and which after rather than vice versa. The 
concept, however, that carries a necessity of synthetic unity with it can 
only be a pure concept of understanding, which does not lie in the perception, 
and that is here the concept of the relation of cause and 
effect, the former of which determines the latter in time, as its consequence,
b and not as something that could merely precede in the imaginationc 
(or not even be perceived at all). Therefore it is only because we 
subject the sequence of the appearances and thus all alteration to the 
law of causality that experience itself, i.e., empirical cognition of them, 
is possible; consequently they themselves, as objects of experience, are 
possible only in accordance with this law.> 

dThe apprehension of the manifold of appearance is always succes-A 189 
sive. The representations of the parts succeed one another. Whether 
they also succeed in the object is a second point for reflection, which is 
not contained in the first. Now one can, to be sure, call everything, and 
even every representation, insofar as one is conscious of it, an object;' 
only what this word is to mean in the case of appearances, not insofar B235 
as they are (as representations) objects,! but rather only insofar as they A 190 
designate an objectl requires a deeper investigation. Insofar as they are, 
merely as representations, at the same time objects of consciousness, 
they do not differ from their apprehension, i.e., from their being taken 
up into the synthesis of the imagination, and one must therefore say 
that the manifold of appearances is always successively generated in the 
mind. If appearances were things in themselves, then no human being 
would be able to assess from the succession of representations how the 
manifold is combined in the object.h For we have to do only with our 
representations; how things in themselves may be (without regard to

representations through which they affect us) is entirely beyond our 

cognitive sphere. Now although the appearances are not things in 

themselves, and nevertheless are the only thing that can be given to us 

for cognition, I still have to show what sort of combination in time per


tains to the manifold in the appearances itself even though the repre


sentation of it in apprehension is always successive. Thus, e.g., the 

apprehension of the manifold in the appearance of a house that stands 

before me is successive. Now the question is whether the manifold of 

this house itself is also successive, which certainly no one will concede. 

Now, however, as soon as I raise my concept of an object to transcen


dental significance, the house is not a thing in itself at all but only an 

appearance, i.e., a representation, the transcendental object of which is 

unknown; therefore what do I understand by the question, how the 

manifold may be combined in the appearance itself (which is yet noth


ing in itself)? Here that which lies in the successive apprehension is 

considered as representation, but the appearance that is given to me, in 

spite of the fact that it is nothing more than a sum of these representa


tions, is considered as their object, with which my concept, which I 

draw from the representations of apprehension, is to agree. One quickly 

sees that, since the agreement of cognition with the object" is truth, 

only the formal conditions of empirical truth can be inquired after here, 

and appearance, in contradistinction to the representations of appre


hension, can thereby only be represented as the object' that is distinct 

from them if it stands under a rule that distinguishes it from every other 

apprehension, and makes one way of combining the manifold necessary. 

That in the appearance which contains the condition of this necessary 

rule of apprehension is the object." 

Now let us proceed to our problem. That something happens, i.e., 
that something or a state comes to be that previously was not, cannot 
B 237 be empirically perceived except where an appearance precedes that does 
not contain this state in itself; for a reality that would follow on an 
A 192 empty time, thus an arising not preceded by any state of things, can be 
apprehended just as little as empty time itself. Every apprehension of an 
occurrence is therefore a perception that follows another one. Since 
this is the case in all synthesis of apprehension, however, as I have 
shown above in the case of the appearance of a house, the apprehension 
of an occurrence is not yet thereby distinguished from any other. Yet I 
also note that, if in the case of an appearance that contains a happening 
I call the preceding state of perception A and the following one B, then 
B can only follow A in apprehension, but the perception A cannot fol

Section III. Systematic representation of all synthetic principles 

low but only precede B. E.g., I see a ship driven downstream. My perception 
of its position downstream follows the perception of its position 
upstream, and it is impossible that in the apprehension of this appearance 
the ship should first be perceived downstream and afterwards upstream. 
The order in the sequence of the perceptions in apprehension 
is therefore here determined, and the apprehension is bound to it. In 
the previous example of a house my perceptions could have begun at its 
rooftop and ended at the ground, but could also have begun below and 
ended above; likewise I could have apprehended the manifold of em-B238 
pirical intuition from the right or from the left. In the series of these 
perceptions there was therefore no determinate order that made it nec-A 193 
essary when I had to begin in the apprehension in order to combine the 
manifold empirically. But this rule is always to be found in the perception 
of that which happens, and it makes the order of perceptions that 
follow one another (in the apprehension of this appearance) necessary. 

In our case I must therefore derive the subjective sequence of apprehension 
from the objective sequence of appearances, for otherwise 
the former would be entirely undetermined and no appearance would 
be distinguished from any other. The former alone proves nothing 
about the connection of the manifold in the object,a because it is entirely 
arbitrary. This connection must therefore consist in the order of 
the manifold of appearance in accordance with which the apprehension 
of one thing (that which happens) follows that of the other (which precedes) 
in accordance with a rule. Only thereby can I be justified in saying 
of the appearance itself, and not merely of my apprehension, that a 
sequence is to be encountered in it, which is to say as much as that I cannot 
arrange the apprehension otherwise than in exactly this sequence. 

In accordance with such a rule there must therefore lie in that which 
in general precedes an occurrence the condition for a rule, in accordance 
with which this occurrence always and necessarily follows; con-B239 
versely, however, I cannot go back from the occurrence and determine 
(through apprehension) what precedes. For no appearance goes back A 194 
from the following point of time to the preceding one, but it is related 
merely to some preceding point or other; on the contrary, the 
progress from a given time to the determinately following one is necessary. 
Hence, since there is still something that follows, I must necessarily 
relate it to something else in general that precedes, and on which it 
follows in accordance with a rule, i.e., necessarily, so that the occurrence, 
as the conditioned, yields a secure indication of some condition, 
but it is the latter that determines the occurrence. 

If one were to suppose that nothing preceded an occurrence that it 
must follow in accordance with a rule, then all sequence of perception

would be determined solely in apprehension, i.e., merely subjectively, 
but it would not thereby be objectively determined which of the perceptions 
must really be the preceding one and which the succeeding 
one. In this way we would have only a play of representations that 
would not be related to any objecta at all, i.e., by means of our perception 
no appearance would be distinguished from any other as far as the 
temporal relation is concerned, since the succession in the apprehending 
is always the same, and there is therefore nothing in the appearance 
that determines it so that a certain sequence is thereby made necessary 
as objective. I would therefore not say that in appearance two states follow 
one another, but rather only that one apprehension follows the 
other, which is something merely subjective, and determines no object,
b and thus cannot count as the cognition of any object (not even in 
the appearance). 

If, therefore, we experience that something happens, then we always 
presuppose that something else precedes it, which it follows in accordance 
with a rule. For without this I would not say of the object" that it 
follows, since the mere sequence in my apprehension, if it is not, by 
means of a rule, determined in relation to something preceding, does 
not justify any sequence in the object.d Therefore I always make my 
subjective synthesis (of apprehension) objective with respect to a rule in 
accordance with which the appearances in their sequence, i.e., as they 
occur, are determined through the preceding state, and only under this 
presupposition alone is the experience of something that happens even 
possible. 

To be sure, it seems as if this contradicts everything that has always 
been said about the course of the use of our understanding, according 
to which it is only through the perception and comparison of sequences 
of many occurrences on preceding appearances that we are led to dis-
B 241 cover a rule, in accordance with which certain occurrences always follow 
certain appearances, and are thereby first prompted to form the 
AI96 concept of cause. On such a footing this concept would be merely empirical, 
and the rule that it supplies, that everything that happens has a 
cause, would be just as contingent as the experience itself: its universality 
and necessity would then be merely feigned, and would have no true 
universal validity, since they would not be grounded a priori but only on 
induction. But the case is the same here as with other pure a priori representations 
(e.g., space and time) that we can extract as clear concepts

experience is hence first brought about through them. Of course the 
logical clarity of this representation of a rule determining the series of 
occurrences, as that of a concept of cause, is only possible if we have 
made use of it in experience, but a consideration of it, as the condition 
of the synthetic unity of the appearances in time, was nevertheless the 
ground of experience itself, and therefore preceded it a priori. 

It is therefore important to show by an example that even in experience 
we never ascribe sequence (of an occurrence, in which something 
happens that previously did not exist) to the object,a and 
distinguish it from the subjective sequence of our apprehension, ex-B 242 
cept when a rule is the ground that necessitates us to observe this 
order of the perceptions rather than another, indeed that it is really 
this necessitation that first makes possible the representation of a suc-A 197 
cession in the object.b 

We have representations in us, of which we can also become conscious. 
But let this consciousness reach as far and be as exact and precise 
as one wants, still there always remain only representations, i.e., 
inner determinations of our mind in this or that temporal relation. Now 
how do we come to posit an objectC for these representations, or ascribe 
to their subjective reality, as modifications, some sort of objective reality? 
Objective significance cannot consist in the relationd to another 
representation (of that which one would call the object), for that would 
simply raise anew the question: How does this representation in turn go 
beyond itself and acquire objective significmce in addition to the subjective 
significance that is proper to it as a determination of the state of 
mind? If we investigate what new characteristic is given to our representations 
by the relatione to an object, and what is the dignity that 
they thereby receive, we find that it does nothing beyond making the 
combination of representations necessary in a certain way, and subjecting 
them to a rule; and conversely that objective significance is con-B 243 
ferred on our representations only insofar as a certain order in their 
temporal relation is necessary. 

In the synthesis of the appearances the manifold representations A 198 
always follow one another. Now by this means no object! at all is represented; 
since through this sequence, which is common to all apprehensions, 
nothing is distinguished from anything else. But as soon as I

preceding state, from which the representation follows in accordance 
with a rule, I represent something as an occurrence, or as something 
that happens, i.e., I cognize an object that I must place in time in a determinate 
position, which, after the preceding state, cannot be otherwise 
assigned to it. Thus if I perceive that something happens, then the 
first thing contained in this representation is that something precedes, 
for it is just in relationa to this that the appearance acquires its temporal 
relation, that, namely, of existing after a preceding time in which it 
did not. But it can only acquire its determinate temporal position in this 
relation through something being presupposed in the preceding state 
on which it always follows, i.e., follows in accordance with a rule: from 
which it results, first, that I cannot reverse the series and place that 
which happens prior to that which it follows; and, second, that if the 
B 244 state that precedes is posited, than this determinate occurrence inevitably 
and necessarily follows. Thereby does it come about that there 
is an order among our representations, in which the present one (inso-


A 199 far as it has come to be) points to some preceding state as a correlate, 
to be sure still undetermined, of this event that is given, which is, however, 
determinately related to the latter, as its consequence, and necessarily 
connected with it in the temporal series. 

Now if it is a necessary law of our sensibility, thus a formal condition 
of all perceptions, that the preceding time necessarily determines 
the following time (in that I cannot arrive at the following time except 
by passing through the preceding one), then it is also an indispensable 
law of the empirical representation of the temporal series that the 
appearances of the past time determine every existence in the following 
time, and that these, as occurrences, do not take place except insofar as 
the former determine their existence in time, i.e., establish it in accordance 
with a rule. For only in the appearances can we empirically 
cognize this continuity in the connectionb of times. 

Understanding belongs to all experience and its possibility, and the 
first thing that it does for this is not to make the representation of the 
objects distinct, but rather to make the representation of an object pos-

B 245 sible at all. Now this happens through its conferring temporal order on 
the appearances and their existence by assigning to each of these, as a 
consequence, a place in time determined a priori in regard to the preceding 
appearances, without which it would not agree with time itself, 

A200 which determines the position of all its parts a priori. Now this determination 
of position cannot be borrowed from the relation of the appearances 
to absolute time (for that is not an object of perception), but, 
conversely, the appearances themselves must determine their positions

rule, from which arises a series of appearances, in which by means of the 
understanding the very same order and constant connectiona in the series 
of possible perceptions is produced and made necessary as would be 
encountered a priori in the form of inner experience (time), in which all 
perceptions would have to have their place. 

That something happens, therefore, is a perception that belongs to a 
possible experience, which becomes actual if! regard the position of the 
appearance as determined in time, thus if I regard it as an objectb that 
can always be found in the connectionc of perceptions in accordance 
with a rule. This rule for determining something with respect to its B 246 
temporal sequence, however, is that in what precedes, the condition is 
to be encountered under which the occurrence always (i.e., necessarily) 
follows. Thus the principle of sufficient reasond is the ground of possi-AWl 
ble experience, namely the objective cognition of appearances with regard 
to their relation in the successive seriese of time. 

The ground of proof of this proposition, however, rests solely on the 
following moments. To all empirical cognition there belongs the synthesis 
of the manifold through the imagination, which is always successive; 
i.e., the representations always follow each other in it. But the 
order of the sequence (what must precede and what must follow) is not 
determined in the imagination at all, and the series of successive! representations 
can be taken backwards just as well as forwards. But if this 
synthesis is a synthesis of apprehension (of the manifold of a given appearance), 
then the order in the objectg is determined, or, to speak more 
precisely, there is therein an order of the successive synthesis that determines 
an object,h in accordance with which something would necessarily 
have to precede and, if this is posited, the other would necessarily 
have to follow. If, therefore, my perception is to contain the cognition 
of an occurrence, namely that something actually happens, then it must 
be an empirical judgment in which one thinks that the sequence is determined, 
i.e., that it presupposes another appearance in time which it 
follows necessarily or in accordance with a rule. Contrariwise, ifI were B 247 
to posit that which precedes and the occurrence did not follow it nec

essarily, then I would have to hold it to be only a subjective play of my 

A202 imaginings, and if I still represented something objective by it I would 
have to call it a mere dream. Thus the relation of appearances (as possible 
perceptions) in accordance with which the existence of that which 
succeeds (what happens) is determined in time necessarily and in accordance 
with a rule by something that precedes it, consequently the 
relation of cause to effect, is the condition of the objective validity of 
our empirical judgments with regard to the series of perceptions, thus 
of their empirical truth, and therefore of experience. Hence the principle 
of the causal relation in the sequence of appearances is valid for all 
objects of experience (under the conditions of succession), since it is itself 
the ground of the possibility of such an experience. 
Here, however, there is a reservation that must be raised. The principle 
of causal connection among appearances is, in our formula, limited 
to the successiona of them, although in the use of this principle it 
turns out that it also applies to their accompaniment,b and cause and effect 
can be simultaneous. E.g., there is warmth in a room that is not to 

B 248 be encountered in the outside air. I look around for the cause, and find 
a heated stove. Now this, as the cause, is simultaneous with its effect, 
the warmth of the chamber; thus here there is no succession' in time 
between cause and effect, rather they are simultaneous, yet the law still 

A203 holds. The majority of efficient causesd in nature are simultaneous with 
their effects, and the temporal sequence of the latter is occasioned only 
by the fact that the cause cannot achieve its entire effect in one instant. 
But in the instant in which the effect first arises, it is always simultaneous 
with the causality of its cause, since if the cause had ceased to be an 
instant before then the effect would never have arisen. Here one must 
note that it is the order of time and not its lapse that is taken account 
of; the relation remains even if no time has elapsed. The time between 
the causality of the cause and its immediate effect can be vanishing 
(they can therefore be simultaneous), but the temporal relation of the 
one to the other still remains determinable. If I consider a ball that lies 
on a stuffed pillow and makes a dent in it as a cause, it is simultaneous 
with its effect. Yet I still distinguish the two by means of the temporal 
relation of the dynamical connection. For if I lay the ball on the pillow 
the dent follows its previously smooth shape; but if (for whatever reason) 
the pillow has a dent, a leaden ball does not follow it.

the effect in relatione to the causality of the cause that precedes it. The

glass is the cause of the rising of the water above its horizontal plane, A204 
though both appearances are simultaneous. For as soon as I draw the 
water into the glass from a larger vessel, something follows, namely the 
alteration of the horizontal state which the water had there into a concave 
state that it assumes in the glass. 

This causality leads to the concept of action, this to the concept of 
force, and thereby to the concept of substance.75 Since I will not crowd 
my critical project, which concerns solely the sources of synthetic a priori 
cognition, with analyses that address merely the elucidation (not the 
amplification) of concepts, I leave the detailed discussion of these concepts 
to a future system of pure reason -especially since one can already 
find such an analysis in rich measure even in the familiar textbooks of 
this sort. Yet I cannot leave untouched the empirical criterion of a substance, 
insofar as it seems to manifest itself better and more readily 
through action than through the persistence of the appearance. 

\Vhere there is action, consequently activity and force, there is also B 250 
substance, and in this alone must the seat of this fruitful source of appearances 
be sought. That is quite well said; but if one would explain 
what one understands by substance, and in so doing avoid a vicious circle, 
then the question is not so easily answered. How will one infer di-A20S 
rectly from the action to the persistence of that which acts, which is yet 
such an essential and singular characteristic of the substance (phaenomenon)? 
Yet given what we have already said, the solution of the question 
is not subject to such a difficulty, though after the usual fashion (proceeding 
merely analytically with its concepts) it would be entirely insoluble. 
Action already signifes the relation of the subject of causality to the 
effect. Now since all effect consists in that which happens, consequently 
in the changeable, which indicates succession in time, the ultimate subject 
of the changeable is therefore that which persists, as the substratum 
of everything that changes, i.e., the substance. For according to the 
principle of causality actions are always the primary ground of all 
change of appearances, and therefore cannot lie in a subject that itself 
changes, since otherwise further actions and another subject, which determines 
this change, would be required. Now on this account action, as 
a sufficient empirical criterion, proves substantiality without it being 
necessary for me first to seek out its persistence through compared per-B 251 
ceptions, a way in which the completeness that is requisite for the quantitya 
and strict universality of the concept could not be attained. For that 
the primary subject of the causality of all arising and perishing cannot 
itself arise and perish (in the field of appearances) is a certain inference, 
which leads to empirical necessity and persistence in existence, conse-A 206 
quently to the concept of a substance as appearance.

If something happens, the mere arising, without regard to that which 
comes to be, is already in itself an object of investigation. It is already 
necessary to investigate the transition from the non-being of a state to 
this state, assuming that this state contained no quality in the appearance. 
This arising concerns, as was shown in section A,a not the substance 
(for that does not arise), but its state. It is therefore merely 
alteration, and not an origination out of nothing. If this origination is 
regarded as the effect of a foreign cause, then it is called creation, which 
cannot be admitted as an occurrence among the appearances, for its 
possibility alone would already undermine the unity of experience, 
though if I consider all things not as phenomena but rather as things in 

B 2 S 2 themselves and as objects of mere understanding, then, though they are 
substances, they can be regarded as dependent for their existence on a 
foreign cause; which, however, would introduce entirely new meanings 
for the words and would not apply to appearances as possible objects of 
experience. 

Now how in general anything can be altered, how it is possible that 

A207 upon a state in one point of time an opposite one could follow in the 
next -of these we have a priori not the least concept. For this acquaintance 
with actual forces is required, which can only be given empirically, 
e.g., acquaintance with moving forces, or, what comes to the same 
thing, with certain successive appearances (as motions) which indicate 
such forces. But the form of such an alteration, the condition under 
which alone it, as the arising of another state, can occur (whatever the 
content, i.e., the state, that is altered might be), consequently the succession 
of the states itself (that which has happened), can still be considered 
a priori according to the law of causality and the conditions of 
time.* 


B 2 S3 If a substance passes out of a state a into another state b, then the 
point in time of the latter is different from the point in time of the first 
state and follows it. Likewise the second state as a reality (in the appearance) 
is also distinguished from the first, in which it did not yet 
exist, as b is distinguished from zero; i.e., if the state b differs from the 
state a even only in magnitude, then the alteration would be an arising 
of b-a, which did not exist in the prior state, and with regard to which 
the latter = o. 

A 207/B 252 * Note well that I am not talking about the alteration of certain relationsb in 
general, but rather of the alteration of the state. Hence if a body is moved uniformly, 
then it does not alter its state (of motion) at all, although it does if its 
motion increases or diminishes.

Section III. Systematic representation of all synthetic principles 

The question therefore arises, how a thing passes from one state = a 
into another one = b. Between two instants there is always a time, and 
between two states in those instances there is always a difference that 
has a magnitude (for all parts of appearances are always in turn magnitudes). 
Thus every transition from one state into another happens in a 
time that is contained between two instants, of which the former determines 
the state from which the thing proceeds and the second the state 
at which it arrives. Both are therefore boundaries of the time of an alteration, 
consequently of the intermediate state between two states, and 
as such they belong to the whole alteration. Now every alteration has a 
cause, which manifests its causality in the entire time during which the 
alteration proceeds. Thus this cause does not produce its alteration suddenly 
(all at once or in an instant), but rather in a time, so that as the B 254 
time increases from the initial instant a to its completion in b, the magnitude 
of the reality (b-a) is also generated through all the smaller degrees 
that are contained between the first and the last. All alteration is 
therefore possible only through a continuous action of causality, which, 
insofar as it is uniform, is called a moment. The alteration does not consist 
of these moments, but it is generated through them as their effect. A209 

That is, now, the law of the continuity of all alteration, the ground of 
which is this: That neither time nor appearance in time consists of smallest 
parts, and that nevertheless in its alteration the state of thing passes 
through all these parts, as elements, to its second state. No difference 
of the real in appearance is the smallest, just as no difference in the 
magnitude of times is, and thus the new state of reality grows out of the 
first, in which it did not exist, through all the infinite degrees of reality, 
the differences between which are all smaller than that between a and a. 

What utility this proposition may have in research into nature does 
not concern us here. But how such a proposition, which seems to amplify 
our cognition of nature so much, is possible completely a priori, 
very much requires our scrutiny, even though it is obvious that it is real 
and correct, and one might therefore believe oneself to be relieved of B 255 
the question how it is possible. For there are so many unfounded presumptions 
of the amplification of our cognition through pure reason 
that it must be adopted as a general principle to be distrustful of them 
all and not to believe and accept even the clearest dogmatic proof of this 
sort of proposition without documents that could provide a well-A2IO 
grounded deduction. 

All growth of empirical cognitions and every advance in perception is 
nothing but an amplification of the determination of inner sense, i.e., a 
progress in time, whatever the objects may be, either appearances or 
pure intuitions. This progress in time determines everything, and is not 
itself determined by anything further: i.e., its parts are only in time, and 
given through the synthesis of it, but they are not given before it. For 

315 



Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. I. Bk. II. Ch. II 

this reason every transition in perception to something that follows in 
time is a determination of time through the generation of this perception 
and, since that is always and in all its parts a magnitude, the generation 
of a perception as a magnitude through all degrees, of which none 
is the smallest, from zero to its determinate degree. It is from this that 
the possibility of cognizing a priori a law concerning the form of alter-

B 256 ations becomes obvious. We anticipate only our own apprehension, the 
formal condition of which, since it is present in us prior to all given appearance, 
must surely be able to be cognized a priori. 
In the same way, then, that time is the a priori sensible condition of the 
possibility of a continuous progress of that which exists to that which follows 
it, the understanding, by means of the unity of apperception, is the 

A2I I a priori condition of the possibility of a continuous determination of all 
positions for the appearances in this time, through the series of causes 
and effects, the former of which inevitably draw the existence of the latter 
after them and thereby make the empirical cognition of temporal relations 
(universally) valid for all time, thus objectively valid.

earth and then subsequently to the moon, and on this account, since the

they exist simultaneously. Now simultaneity is the existence of the manifold 
at the same time. But one cannot perceive time itself and thereby

Section III. Systematic representation of all synthetic principles 

derive from the fact that things are positioned at the same time that 
their perceptions can follow each other reciprocally. The synthesis of 
the imagination in apprehension would therefore only present each of 
these perceptions as one that is present in the subject when the other is 
not, and conversely, but not that the objectsa are simultaneous, i.e., that 
ifthe one is then the other also is in the same time, and that this is necessary 
in order for the perceptions to be able to succeed each other reciprocally. 
Consequently, a concept of the understanding of the 
reciprocal sequence of the determinations of these things simultaneously 
existing externally to each other is required in order to say that the 
reciprocal sequence of perceptions is grounded in the object,b and 
thereby to represent the simultaneity as objective. Now, however, the 
relation of substances in which the one contains determinations the 
ground of which is contained in the other is the relation of influence, B 258 
and, if the latter reciprocally contains the ground of the determinations 
of the former, it is the relation of community or interaction. Thus the 
simultaneity of substances in space cannot be cognized in experience 
otherwise than under the presupposition of an interaction among them; 
this is therefore also the condition of the possibility of the things themselves 
as objects of experience.> 

CThings are simultaneous insofar as they exist at one and the same A 2 I I 
time. But how does one cognize that they exist at one and the same 
time? If the order in the synthesis of the apprehension of this manifold 
is indifferent, i.e., if it can proceed from A through B, C, and D to E, 
but also conversely from E to A. For if they existedd in time one after 
the other (in the order that begins with A and ends at E), then it would 
be impossible to begin the apprehension at the perception of E and proceed 
backwards to A, since A would belong to past time, and thus can 
no longer be an object of apprehension.'·77

following note: "Space makes community possible. Now since the thinking being with 
all its faculties, whose effects belong merely to inner sense, is not a relation [Relation] of 
space, the commercium of the soul with the body is therefore not comprehensible. The 
community of things in themselves must either have a third substance, in which they 
exist as accidentia and are in relation to one another -Spinozism -or, since this won't do, 
it remains incomprehensible. Space is itself the phaenomenon of possible community. If I 
consider bodies merely as phaenomena that are in me, the cognitive faculty of inner sense 
may well stand in community with those of outer sense." (E LXXXVI, p. 34; 23:31-2) 

317 



Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. I. Bk. II. Ch. II 

each of them would be completely isolated, i.e., none would affect any 
other nor receive a reciprocal influence from it, then I say that their simultaneity 
would not be the object of a possible perception, and that 
B 259 the existence of the one could not lead to the existence of the other by 
any path of empirical synthesis. For if you thought that they were separated 
by a completely empty space, then the perception that proceeds 
from one to the other in time would certainly determine the existence 
of the latter by means of a succeeding perception, but would not be able 
to distinguish whether that appearance objectively follows the former 
or is rather simultaneous with it. 

In addition to the mere existence there must therefore be something 
through which A determines the position of B in time, and conversely 
also something by which B does the same for A, since only under this 
condition can those substances be empirically represented as existing 
simultaneously. Now only that determines the position of another in 
time which is the cause of it or its determinations. Thus each substance 
(since it can be a consequencea only with regard to its determinations) 
must simultaneously contain the causality of certain determinations in 
the other and the effects of the causality of the other, i.e., they must 


A 2 I 3 stand in dynamical community (immediately or mediately) if their simultaneity 
is to be cognized in any possible experience. But now everything 
in regard to objects of experience is necessary without which the 

B 260 experience of these objects itself would be impossible. Thus it is necessary 
for all substances in appearance, insofar as they are simultaneous, 
to stand in thoroughgoing community of interaction with each other. 
The word "community"b is ambiguous in our language, and can 
mean either communio or commercium.c We use it here in the latter sense, 
as a dynamical community, without which even the local community 
(communio spatii)d could never be empirically cognized. From our experiences 
it is easy to notice that only continuous influence in all places in 
space can lead our sense from one object to another, that the light that 
plays between our eyes and the heavenly bodies effects a mediate community 
between us and the latter and thereby proves the simultaneity 
of the latter, and that we cannot empirically alter any place (perceive 
this alteration) without matter everywhere making the perception of 
our position possible; and only by means of its reciprocal influence can 
it establish their simultaneity and thereby the coexistence of even the 
most distant objects (though only mediately). Without community

Section III. Systematic representation of all synthetic principles 

every perception (of appearance in space) is broken off from the others, A214 
and the chain of empirical representations, i.e., experience, would have 
to start entirely over with every new objecta without the previous one B 261 
being in the least connected or being able to stand in a temporal relation 
with it. I do not in the least hereby mean to refute empty space; 
that may well exist where perceptions do not reach, and thus where no 
empirical cognition of simultaneity takes place; but it is then hardly an 
objectb for our possible experience at all. 

The following can serve as an elucidation. In our mind all appearances, 
as contained in a possible experience, must stand in a community 
(communio) of apperception, and insofar as the objects are to be represented 
as being connected by existing simultaneously, they must reciprocally 
determine their position in one time and thereby constitute a 
whole. If this subjective community is to rest on an objective ground, or 
is to be related to appearances as substances, then the perception of one, 
as ground, must make possible the perception of the other, and conversely, 
so that the succession that always exists in the perceptions, as 
apprehensions, will not be ascribed to the objects, c but these can instead 
be represented as existing simultaneously. But this is a reciprocal influence, 
i.e., a real community (commercium) of substances, without which 
the empirical relation of simultaneity could not obtain in experience. A 2 15 
Through this commerced the appearances, insofar as they stand outside 
one another and yet in connection, constitute a composite (compositum B 262 
reale), and composites! of this sort are possible in many ways. Hence the 
three dynamical relations, from which all others arise, are those of inherence, 
of consequence, and of composition.g 

* * * 

These, then, are the three analogies of experience. They are nothing 
other than principles of the determination of the existence of appearances 
in time, in accordance with all three of its modi: that of the relation 
to time itself, as a magnitude (the magnitude of existence, i.e., 
duration); that of the relation in time, as a series (one after another); and 
finally that in time as a sum of all existence (simultaneous). This unity 
of time-determination is through and through dynamical, i.e., time is 
not regarded as that within which experience immediately determines

the position of each existence, which is impossible, since absolute time 
is not an object of perception by means of which appearances could be 
held together; rather the rule of the understanding, through which 
alone the existence of appearances can acquire synthetic unity in temporal 
relations, determines the position of each of them in time, thus a 
priori and validly for each and every time. 


A216/B263 By nature (in the empirical sense) we understand the combination of 
appearances as regards their existence, in accordance with necessary 
rules, i.e., in accordance with laws. There are therefore certain laws, 
and indeed a priori, which first make a nature possible; the empirical 
laws can only obtain and be found by means of experience, and indeed 
in accord with its original laws, in accordance with which experience itself 
first becomes possible. Our analogies therefore really exhibit the 
unity of nature in the combination of all appearances under certain exponents, 
which express nothing other than the relation of time (insofar 
as it comprehends all existence in itself) to the unity of apperception, 
which can only obtain in synthesis in accordance with rules. Thus together 
they say: All appearances lie in one nature, and must lie therein, 
since without this a priori unity no unity of experience, thus also no determination 
of the objects in it, would be possible. 
About the method of proof, however, which we have employed in the 
case of these transcendental laws of nature, and about its singularity, 
one remark is to be made, which must be very important as a precept 
for every other attempt to prove intellectual and at the same time synthetic 
a priori propositions. If we had wanted to prove these analogies 
dogmatically, i.e., from concepts -namely, that everything that exists 
B 264 will only be encountered in that which persists; that every occurrence 

A2 I 7 presupposes something in the previous state, which it follows in accordance 
with a rule; finally, that in the manifold that is simultaneous the 
states are simultaneous in relationa to each other in accordance with a 
rule (stand in community) -then all effort would have been entirely in 
vain. For one cannot get from one object and its existence to the existence 
of another or its way of existing through mere concepts of these 
things, no matter how much one analyzes them. So what is left for us? 
The possibility of experience, as a cognition in which in the end all objects 
must be able to be given to us if their representation is to have objective 
reality for us. In this third thing, now, the essential form of 
which consists in the synthetic unity of the apperception of all appearances, 
we found a priori conditions of the thoroughgoing and necessary 
time-determination of all existence in appearance, without which even 
empirical time-determination would be impossible, and we found rules 
of synthetic a priori unity by means of which we could anticipate expe

A219 Elucidation 


The categories of modality have this peculiarity: as a determination of 
the objecta they do not augment the concept to which they are ascribed 
in the least, but rather express only the relationb to the faculty of cognition. 
If the concept of a thing is already entirely complete, I can still 
ask about this object whether it is merely possible, or also actual, or, if 
it is the latter, whether it is also necessary? No further determinations 
in the objectC itself are hereby thought; rather, it is only asked: how is 
the object itself (together with all its determinations) related to the understanding 
and its empirical use, to the empirical power of judgment, 
and to reason (in its application to experience)? 

For this very reason the principles of modality are also nothing further 
than definitions of the concepts of possibility, actuality, and necessity 
in their empirical use, and thus at the same time restrictions of all 
categories to merely empirical use, without any permission and allowance 
for their transcendental use. For if the categories are not to 


B 267 have a merely logical significance and analytically express the form of 
thinking, but are to concern things and their possibility, actuality, and 
necessity, then they must pertain to possible experience and its synthetic 
unity, in which alone objects of cognition are given. 

A220 The postulate of the possibility of things thus requires that their con

thought." (E XCIII, p. 36; 2 n 2) 

"That which exists, thus in other things outside our thoughts, is thoroughly determined. 
This proposition is the principle [Princip] of the concept of an ens realissimus

than Beziehung, even here where he is speaking about a relation between the cognitive 
faculty and its object rather than among objects, and thus by the usage of the

noted, our "relation" translates Verhalwis.

Section III. Systematic representation of all synthetic principles 

cept agree with the formal conditions of an experience in general. This, 
however, namely the objective form of experience in general, contains all 
synthesis that is requisite for the cognition of objects.a A concept that includes 
a synthesis in it is to be held as empty, and does not relate to any 
object, if this synthesis does not belong to experience, either as borrowed 
from it, in which case it is an empirical concept, or as one on which, as 
a priori condition, experience in general (its form) rests, and then it is a 
pure concept, which nevertheless belongs to experience, since its objectb 
can be encountered only in the latter. For whence will one derive the 
character of the possibility of an object that is thought by means of a synthetic 
a priori concept, if not from the synthesis that constitutes the form 
of the empirical cognition of objects?' That in such a concept no contradiction 
must be contained is, to be sure, a necessary logical condition; but B 268 
it is far from sufficient for the objective reality of the concept, i.e., for the 
possibility of such an object as is thought through the concept,79 Thus in 
the concept of a figure that is enclosed between two straight lines there is 
no contradiction, for the concepts of two straight lines and their intersection 
contain no negation of a figure; rather the impossibility rests not A22I 
on the concept in itself, but on its construction in space, i.e., on the conditions 
of space and its determinations; but these in turn have their objective 
reality, i.e., they pertain to possible things, because they contain in 
themselves a priori the form of experience in general. 

We shall now make obvious the extensive utility and influence of this 
postulate of possibility. If I represent to myself a thing that persists, so 
that everything that changes merely belongs to its states, I can never 
cognize from such a concept alone that such a thing is possible. Or, if 
I represent something to myself that is so constituted that if it is 
posited something else always and inevitably succeeds it, this may well 
be able to be so thought without contradiction; but whether such a 
property (as causality) will be encountered in any possible thing cannot 
thereby be judged. Finally, I can represent various things (sub-B 269 
stances) to myself that are so constituted that the state of one is 
followed by a consequence in the state of the other, and conversely; but 
whether such a relation can pertain to any things cannot be derived 
from these concepts, which contain a merely arbitrary synthesis. Thus 
only from the fact that these concepts express a priori the relations of 
the perceptions in every experience does one cognize their objective 
reality, i.e., their transcendental truth, and, to be sure, independently A222 
of experience, but yet not independently of all relationd to the form of

an experience in general and the synthetic unity in which alone objects 
can be empirically cognized. 

But if one wanted to make entirely new concepts of substances, of 
forces, and of interactions from the material that perception offers us, 
without borrowing the example of their connection from experience itself, 
then one would end up with nothing but figments of the brain, for 
the possibility of which there would be no indications at all, since in 
their case one did not accept experience as instructress nor borrow 
these concepts from it. Invented concepts of this sort cannot acquire the 
character of their possibility a priori, like the categories, as conditions 
on which all experience depends, but only a posteriori, as ones given 
through experience itself, and their possibility must either be cognized 

B 2 70 a posteriori and empirically or not cognized at all. A substance that was 
persistently present in space yet without filling it (like that intermediate 
thing between matter and thinking beings, which some would introduce),
80 or a special fundamental power of our mind to intuit the 
future (not merely, say, to deduce it), or, finally, a faculty of our mind to 
stand in a community of thoughts with other men (no matter how dis


A223 tant they may be)81 -these are concepts the possibility of which is entirely 
groundless, because it cannot be grounded in experience and its 
known laws, and without this it is an arbitrary combination of thoughts 
that, although it contains no contradiction, still can make no claim to 
objective reality, thus to the possibility of the sort of object that one 
would here think. As far as reality is concerned, it is evidently intrinsically 
forbidden to think it in concreto without getting help from experience, 
because it can only pertain to sensation, as the matter of 
experience, and does not concern the form of the relation that one can 
always play with in fictions. a 
But I leave aside everything the possibility of which can only be derived 
from actuality in experience, and consider here only the possibility 
of things through concepts a priori, about which I proceed to 

B27! assert that it can never occur by itself solely from such concepts, but 
always only as formal and objective conditions of an experience in 
general. 
It may look, to be sure, as if the possibility of a triangle could be cognized 
from its concept in itself (it is certainly independent of experience); 
for in fact we can give it an object entirely a priori, i.e., construct 
it. But since this is only the form of an object, it would still always re


A224 main only a product of the imagination, the possibility of whose object 
would still remain doubtful, as requiring something more, namely that 
such a figure be thought solely under those conditions on which all objects 
of experience rest. Now that space is a formal a priori condition of

outer experiences, that this very same formative a synthesis by means of 
which we construct a figure in imagination is entirely identical with that 
which we exercise in the apprehension of an appearance in order to 
make a concept of experience of it -it is this alone that connects with 
this concept the representation of the possibility of such a thing. And 
thus the possibility of continuous magnitudes, indeed even of magnitudes 
in general, since the concepts of them are all synthetic, is never 
clear from the concepts themselves, but only from them as formal conditions 
of the determination of objects in experience in general; and B 272 
where should one want to seek objects that correspond to the concepts, 
if not in the experience through which alone objects are given to 
us? -although without anticipating experience itself we can cognize 
and characterize the possibility of things solely in relation to the formal 
conditions under which something can be determined as an object in 
experience at all, thus fully a priori but only in relationb to these conditions 
and within their boundaries.82 

The postulate for cognizing the actuality of things requires percep-A2 2 5 
tion, thus sensation of which one is conscious -not immediate perception 
of the object itself the existence of which is to be cognized, but still 
its connection with some actual perception in accordance with the 
analogies of experience, which exhibit all real connection in an experience 
in general. 

In the mere concept of a thing no characteristic of its existence can 
be encountered at all. For even if this concept is so complete that it lacks 
nothing required for thinking of a thing with all of its inner detenninations, 
still existence has nothing in the least to do with all of this, but 
only with the question of whether such a thing is given to us in such a 
way that the perception of it could in any case precede the concept. For 
that the concept precede the perception signifies its mere possibility; but B 273 
perception, which yields the material for the concept, is the sole characteristic 
of actuality. However, one can also cognize the existence of the 
thing prior to the perception of it, and therefore cognize it comparatively 
a priori, if only it is connectedC with some perceptions in accordance 
with the principles of their empirical connection d (the analogies). 
For in that case the existence of the thing is still connectede with our 
perceptions in a possible experience, and with the guidance of the analo-A226 
gies we can get from our actual perceptions to the thing in the series of 
possible perceptions. Thus we cognize the existence of a magnetic mat

ter penetrating all bodies from the perception of attracted iron filings, 
although an immediate perception of this matter is impossible for us 
given the constitution of our organs. For in accordance with the laws of 
sensibility and the context of our perceptions we could also happen upon 
the immediate empirical intuition of it in an experience if our senses, the 
crudeness of which does not affect the form of possible experience in 
general, were finer. Thus wherever perception and whatever is appended 
to it in accordance with empirical laws reaches, there too reaches our 
cognition of the existence of things. If we do not begin with experience, 

B274 or proceed in accordance with laws of the empirical connectiona of appearances, 
then we are only making a vain display of wanting to discover 
or research the existence of any thing. b<However, a powerful objection 
against these rules for proving existence mediately is made by idealism, 
the refutation of which belongs here. 

* * * 


Refutation of Idealism83 


Idealism (I mean material idealism) is the theory that declares the existence 
of objects in space outside us to be either merely doubtful and indemonstrable, 
or else false and impossible; the former is the 
problematic idealism of Descartes, who declares only one empirical assertion 
(assertio), namely I am, to be indubitable; the latter is the dogmatic 
idealism of Berkeley, who declares space, together with all the 
things to which it is attached as an inseparable condition, to be something 
that is impossible in itself, and who therefore also declares things 
in space to be merely imaginary.84 Dogmatic idealism is unavoidable if 
one regards space as a property that is to pertain to the things in themselves; 
for then it, along with everything for which it serves as a condition, 
is a non-entity. The ground for this idealism, however, has been 
undercut by us in the Transcendental Aesthetic. Problematic idealism, 

B 275 which does not assert anything about this, but rather professes only our 
incapacity for proving an existence outside us from our own by means of 
immediate experience, is rational and appropriate for a thorough philosophical 
manner of thought, allowing, namely, no decisive judgment 
until a sufficient proof has been found. The proof that is demanded must 
therefore establish that we have experience and not merely imagination 
of outer things, which cannot be accomplished unless one can prove 
that even our inner experience, undoubted by Descartes, is possible 
only under the presupposition of outer experience.

Theorem 

The mere, but empirically determined, consciousness of my own 
existence proves the existence of objects in space outside me. 


Proof 

I am conscious of my existence as determined in time. All time-determination 
presupposes something persistent in perception. This persistent 
thing, however, cannot be something in me, since my own 
existence in time can first be determined only through this persistent 
thing.a Thus the perception of this persistent thing is possible only 
through a thing outside me and not through the mere representation 
of a thing outside me. Consequently, the determination of my existence 
in time is possible only by means of the existenceb of actual things that 
I perceive outside myself. Now consciousness in time is necessarily B 276 
combined with the consciousness of the possibility of this time-determination: 
Therefore it is also necessarily combined with the existence 
of the things outside me, as the condition of time-determination; i.e., 
the consciousness of my own existence is at the same time an immediate 
consciousness of the existence of other things outside me. 

Note 1. One will realize that in the preceding proof the game that 
idealism plays has with greater justice been turned against it. Idealism 
assumed that the only immediate experience is inner experience, and 
that from that outer things could only be inferred, but, as in any case 
in which one infers from given effects to determinate causes, only unreliably, 
since the cause of the representations that we perhaps falsely 
ascribe to outer things can also lie in us. Yet here it is proved that outer 
experience is really immediate, * that only by means of it is possible not, B 277 


* The immediate consciousness of the existence of outer things is not presup-B 276 
posed but proved in the preceding theorem, whether we have insight into the 
possibility of this consciousness or not. The question about the latter would 
be whether we have only an inner sense but no outer one, rather merely outer 
imagination. But it is clear that in order for us even to imagine something as 
external, i.e., to exhibit it to sense in intuition, we must already have an outer B 277 
sense, and by this means immediately distinguish the mere receptivity of an 
a According to the revised preface (Bxxxix), this sentence is to be replaced by the following: 
"This persistent thing, however, cannot be an intuition in me. For all grounds of determination 
of my existence that can be encountered in me are representations, and as 
such require something persistent that is distinct even from them, in relation to which 
their change, thus my existence in the time in which they change, can be determined." 

b Existenz 
, Existenz

to be sure, the consciousness of our own existence, but its determination 
in time, i.e., inner experience. Of course, the representation I am, 
which expresses the consciousness that can accompany all thinking, is 
that which immediately includes the existencea of a subject in itself, but 
not yet any cognition of it, thus not empirical cognition, i.e., experience; 
for to that there belongs, besides the thought of something existing, 
intuition, and in this case inner intuition, i.e., time, in regard to 
which the subject must be determined, for which outer objects are absolutely 
requisite, so that inner experience itself is consequently only 
mediate and possible only through outer experience.85 

Note 2. All use of our faculty of cognition in experience for the determination 
of time agrees with this completely. Not only can we perceiveb 
all time-determination only through the change in outer relations 
(motion) relative to that which persists in space (e.g., the motion of the 

B 278 sun with regard to the objects on the earth);86 we do not even have anything 
persistent on which we could base the concept of a substance, as 
intuition, except merely matter, and even this persistence is not drawn 
from outer experience, but rather presupposed a priori as the necessary 
condition of all time-determination, thus also as the determination of 
inner sense in regard to our own existence through the existenceC of 
outer things. The consciousness of myself in the representation I is no 
intuition at all, but a merely intellectual representation of the selfactivity 
of a thinking subject. And hence this I does not have the least 
predicate of intuition that, as persistent, could serve as the correlate for 
time-determination in inner sense, as, say, impenetrability in matter, as 
empirical intuition, does.87 
Note 3. From the fact that the existenced of outer objects is required 
for the possibility of a determinate consciousness of our self it does not 
follow that every intuitive representation of outer things includes at the 
same time their existence, for that may well be the mere effect of the 
imagination (in dreams as well as in delusions); but this is possible 
merely through the reproduction of previous outer perceptions, which, 
as has been shown, are possible only through the actuality of outer objects. 
Here it had to be proved only that inner experience in general is 
possible only through outer experience in general. Whether this or that 

outer intuition from the spontaneity that characterizes every imagining. For 
even merely to imagine an outer sense would itself annihilate the faculty of 
intuition, which is to be determined through the imagination.

putative experience is not mere imagination must be ascertained according 
to its particular determinations and through its coherence with 
the criteria of all actual experience. 

aFinally, as far as the third postulate is concerned, it pertains to material A226 
necessity in existence, not the merely formal and logical necessity in the 
connection of concepts.88 Now since no existenceb of objects of the 
senses can be cognized fully a priori, but always only comparatively a priori 
relative to another already given existence, but since nevertheless A227 
even then we can only arrive at an existence that must be contained 
somewhere in the nexus of experience of which the given perception is 
a part, the necessity of existenced can thus never be cognized from concepts 
but rather always only from the connection with that which is perceived, 
in accordance with general laws of experience. Now there is no 
existence that could be cognized as necessary under the condition of 
other given appearances except the existence of effects from given 
causes in accordance with laws of causality. Thus it is not the existence 
of things (substances) but of their state of which alone we can cognize 
the necessity, and moreover only from other states, which are given in B 280 
perception, in accordance with empirical laws of causality. From this it 
follows that the criterion of necessity lies solely in the law of possible experience 
that everything that happens is determined a priori through its 
cause in appearance. Hence we cognize only the necessity of effects in 
nature, the causes ofwhich are given to us, and the mark of necessity in 
existence does not reach beyond the field of possible experience, and 
even in this it does not hold of the existence' of things, as substances, 
since these can never be regarded as empirical effects, or as something 
that happens and arises. Necessity therefore concerns only the relations 
of appearances in accordance with the dynamical law of causality, and A228 
the possibility grounded upon it of inferring a priori from some given 
existence (a cause) to another existence (the effect). Everything that happens 
is hypothetically necessary; that is a principle that subjects alteration 
in the world to a law, i.e., a rule of necessary existence, without 
which not even nature itself would obtain. Hence the proposition 
"Nothing happens through a mere accident" (in mundo non datur casus)!

is an a priori law of nature; likewise the proposition "No necessity in nature 
is blind, but is rather conditioned, consequently comprehensible 
B281 necessity" (non datur fatum).a Both are laws of the sort through which 
the play of alterations is subjected to a nature of things (as appearances), 
or, what is the same thing, to the unity of the understanding, in 
which alone they can belong to an experience, as the synthetic unity of 
appearances. Both of these belong to the dynamical principles. The first 
is properly a consequence of the principle of causality (under the analogies 
of experience). The second belongs to the principles of modality, 
which adds to the causal determination the concept of necessity, which, 
however, stands under a rule of understanding. The principle of continuity 
forbade any leap in the series of appearances (alterations) (in 
A229 mundo non datur saltus),b but also any gap or cleft between two appearances 
in the sum of all empirical intuitions in space (non datur hiatus);C 
for one can express the proposition thus: "Nothing can enter experience 
that proves a vacuumd or even permits it as a part of empirical synthesis." 
For as far as concerns the void that one might think of outside of 
the field of possible experience (the world), this does not belong to the 
jurisdiction of the mere understanding, which only decides about questions 
concerning the use of given appearances for empirical cognition, 
and it is a problem for ideal reason, which goes beyond the sphere of a 


B 282 possible experience and would judge about what surrounds and bounds 
this, and must therefore be considered in the transcendental dialectic. 
We could easily represent the order of these four propositions (in mundo 
non datur hiatus, non datur saltus, non datur casus, non datur fatum)' in accordance 
with the order of the categories, just like all principles of transcendental 
origin, and show each its position, but the already practiced 
reader will do this for himself or easily discover the clue to it. However, 
they are all united simply in this, that they do not permit anything in 
empirical synthesis that could violate or infringe the understanding and 
the continuous connectiOIv of all appearances, i.e., the unity of its concepts. 
For it is in this alone that the unity of experience, in which all 
perceptions must have their place, is possible. 
Whether the field of possibility is greater than the field that contains 
everything actual, and whether the latter is in turn greater than the setg

Section III. Systematic representation of all synthetic principles 

solved synthetically, though they also fall under the jurisdiction of reason 
alone; for they mean, roughly, to ask whether all things, as appearances, 
belong together in the sum total and the context of a single 
experience, of which each given perception is a part which therefore 
could not be combined with any other appearances, or whether my per-B 283 
ceptions could belong to more than one possible experience (in their 
general connection).a The understanding gives a priori to experience in 
general only the rule, in accordance with the subjective and formal conditions 
of sensibility as well as of apperception, which alone make it 
possible. Even were they possible, we could still not conceive of and 
make comprehensible other forms of intuition (than space and time) or 
other forms of understanding (than the discursive form of thinking, or 
that of cognition through concepts); and even if we could, they would 
still not belong to experience, as the sole cognition in which objects are 
given to us. Whether other perceptions than those which in general be-A23 I 
long to our entire possible experience and therefore an entirely different 
field of matter can obtain cannot be decided by the understanding, 
which has to do only with the synthesis of that which is given. 
Otherwise the poverty of our usual inferences through which we bring 
forth a great realm of possibility, of which everything actual (every object 
of experience) is only a small part, is very obvious. "Everything actual 
is possible" -from this there follows naturally, in accordance with 
the logical rules of conversion, the merely particular proposition, 
"Something possible is actual," which then seems to mean as much as 
"Much is possible that is not actual." It certainly looks as if one could B 284 
increase the number of that which is possible beyond that of the actual, 
since something must be added to the former to constitute the latter. 
But I do not acknowledge this addition to the possible. For that which 
would have to be added to the possible would be impossible. All that 
can be added to my understanding is something beyond agreement with 
the formal conditions of experience, namely connection with some perception 
or other; but whatever is connected with this in accordance 
with empirical laws is actual, even if it is not immediately perceived. 
However, that another series of appearances in thoroughgoing connection 
with that which is given to me in perception, thus more than a sin-A232 
gle all-encompassing experience, is possible, cannot be inferred from 
that which is given, and even less without anything being given at all; 
for without matterb nothing at all can be thought. That which is possible 
only under conditions that are themselves merely possible is not 
possible in all respects. But this is the way the question is taken when

one wants to know whether the possibility of things extends further 
than experience can reach.89 
I have only mentioned these questions in order not to leave a gap in 

B 285 what according to common opinion belongs among the concepts of the 
understanding. In fact, however, absolute possibility (which is valid in 
every respect) is no mere concept of the understanding, and can in no 
way be of empirical use, rather it belongs solely to reason, which goes 
beyond all possible empirical use of the understanding. Hence we have 
had to satisfy ourselves here with a merely critical remark, but otherwise 
left the matter in obscurity pending further treatment later on. 
Since I would now conclude this fourth section, and with it at the 
same time the system of all principles of the pure understanding, I must 
still provide the reasona why I have called the principles b of modality 
"postulates." I will not here take this expression in the significance that, 

A2 3 3 contrary to the usage' of mathematics, to whom it nevertheless properly 
belongs, some recent philosophical writers90 have used it, namely that 
postulation means the same as putting a proposition forth as immediately 
certain without justification or proof; for if we were to allow that 
synthetic propositions, no matter how evident they might be, could 
claim unconditional acceptance without any deduction, merely on their 
own claim, then all critique of the understanding would be lost, and, 
since there is no lack of audacious pretensions that common belief does 
not refuse (which is, however, no credential),d our understanding would 
therefore be open to every delusion, without being able to deny its approval 
to those claims that, though unjustifable, demand to be admitted 
as actual axioms in the very same confident tone. When, therefore, a 
determination is added a priori to the concept of a thing, then for such 
a proposition if not a proof then at least a deduction of the legitimacy 
of its assertion must unfailingly be supplied. 
The principles of modality are not, however, objective-synthetic, since 
the predicates of possibility, actuality, and necessity do not in the least 
augment the concept of which they are asserted in such a way as to add 
something to the representation of the object. But since they are nevertheless 
always synthetic, they are so only subjectively, i.e., they add to the 
concept of a thing (the real), about which they do not otherwise say anything, 
the cognitive power whence it arises and has its seat, so that, if it 
is merely connected in the understanding with the formal conditions of 
experience, its object is called possible; if it is in connectione with per-

by means of the understanding, then the objecta is actual; and if 
it is determined through the connectionb of perceptions in accordance 

with concepts, then the object is called necessary. The principles of 


modality therefore do not assert of a concept anything other than the action 
of the cognitive faculty through which it is generated. Now in 
mathematics a postulate is the practical proposition that contains nothing 
except the synthesis through which we first give ourselves an object 
and generate its concept, e.g., to describe a circle with a given line from 
a given point on a plane; and a proposition of this sort cannot be proved, 
since the procedure that it demands is precisely that through which we 
first generate the concept of such a figure. Accordingly we can postulate 
the principles of modality with the very same right, since they do not 
augment* their concept of things in general, but rather only indicate the A235 
way in which in general it is combined with the cognitive power.'

is at the same time its connection with perception.

B 288 a<General Note on the System of Principles 

It is very remarkable that we cannot have insight into the possibility of 


any thing in accordance with the mere categories, but we must always 

have available an intuition in order for it to display the objective reality 

of the pure concept of the understanding. Take, e.g., the categories of 

relation.b How I) something can exist only as subject, not as mere de


termination of other things, i.e., can be substance; or how 2) because 

something is, something else must be, thus how something can be a 

cause at all; or 3) how, if several things exist, from the existence of one 

of them something about the others follows and vice versa, and in this 

way a community of substances can obtain -insight into these cannot 

be had from mere concepts at all. The same thing also holds of the 


other categories, e.g., how a thing can be one with a number of others 

taken together, i.e., be a magnitude, etc. Thus as long as intuition is 

lacking, one does not know whether one thinks an object:" through the 

categories, and whether there can ever be any object that even fits 

them; and so it is confirmed that the categories are not by themselves 

cognitions, but mere fonns of thought for making cognitions out of 

B 289 given intuitions. -In the same way it follows that no synthetic proposition 
can be made out of mere categories -e.g., in all existence there is 
substance, i.e., something that can exist only as subject and never as 
mere predicate; or, everything is a quantum, etc. -if there is nothing 
that we can use in order to go beyond a given concept and thereby connect 
it with another. Hence also no one has ever succeeded in proving 
a synthetic proposition merely from pure concepts of the understanding, 
e.g., the proposition "Every contingently existing thing has a 
cause." One could never get further than to prove that without this relatione 
we could not comprehend the existence! of the contingent at 


all, i.e., cognize the existence of such a thing a priori through the understanding; 
from which, however, it does not follow that this is also the 
condition of the possibility of things themselves. Hence if one will look 
back on our proof of the principle of causality, one will become aware 
that we could prove it only of objectsg of possible experience: 
"Everything that happens (every occurrence) presupposes a cause"; and 
indeed we could prove it only as a principleh of the possibility of expe

Section III. Systematic representation of all synthetic principles 

rience, hence of the cognition of an objecta given in empirical intuition, 
and not from mere concepts. That the proposition "Everything 
contingent must have a cause" may be evident to everyone from mere 
concepts is not to be denied; but then the concept of the contingent is B 290 
already taken in such a way that it contains, not the category of modality 
(as something, the non-existence of which can be thought), but that 
of relationb (as something that can only exist as the consequence of 
something else), and then it is, of course, an identical proposition: 
"V\1hat can only exist as a consequence has its cause." In fact, when we 
are to give examples of contingent existence, we always appeal to alterations 
and not merely to the possibility of the thought of the opposite.*,
91 Alteration, however, is an occurrence that is possible as such B29I 
only through a cause, the non-being of which is thus possible in itself; 
and thus one cognizes contingency from the fact that something can 
exist only as the effect of a cause; thus if a thing is assumed to be contingent, 
it's an analytic proposition to say that it has a cause. 

It is even more remarkable, however, that in order to understand the 
possibility of things in accordance with the categories, and thus to establish 
the objective reality of the latter, we do not merely need intuitions, 
but always outer intuitions. If we take, e.g., the pure concept of 
relation,c we find that I) in order to give something that persists in intuition, 
corresponding to the concept of substance (and thereby to establish 
the objective reality of this concept), we need an intuition in 
space (of matter), since space alone persistently determines, while time, 
however, and thus everything that is in inner sense, constantly flows. 2) 
In order to exhibit alteration as the intuition corresponding to the concept 
of causality, we must take motion, as alteration in space, as our example, 
indeed only by that means can we make alterations, the 
possibility of which cannot be comprehended by any pure understand


* One can easily think of the not-being of matter, but the ancients did not infer B 290 
its contingency from that. And even the change from the being to the nonbeing 
of a given state of a thing, in which all alteration consists, does not prove 
the contingency of this state at all, as it were, from the actuality of its opposite; 
e.g., the rest of the body that follows its motion still does not prove the 
contingency of its motion just because the former is the opposite of the latter. 
For this opposite is here opposed to the other only logically, not realiter. In 
order to prove the contingency of the motion of the body, one would have to 
prove that instead of the motion in the preceding point of time, the body 
could have been at rest then, not that it rests later; for in the later case the 
two opposites are perfectly consistent.

ing, intuitable. Alteration is the combination of contradictorily opposed 
determinations in the existence of one and the same thing. Now how it 
B 292 is possible that from a given state an opposed state of the same thing 
should follow not only cannot be made comprehensible by reason without 
an example, but cannot even be made understandable without intuition, 
and this intuition is the motion of a point in space, the existence 
of which in different places (as a sequence of opposed determinations) 
first makes alteration intuitable to us; for in order subsequently to make 
even inner alterations thinkable, we must be able to grasp time, as the 
form of inner sense, figuratively through a line, and grasp the inner alteration 
through the drawing of this line (motion), and thus grasp the 
successive existencea of ourself in different states through outer intuition; 
the real ground of which is that all alteration presupposes something 
that persists in intuition, even in order merely to be perceived as 
alteration, but there is no persistent intuition to be found in inner 
sense. -Finally, the possibility of the category of community is not to 
be comprehended at all through mere reason, and thus it is not possible 
to have insight into the objective reality of this concept without 
intuition, and indeed outer intuition in space. For how would one conceiveb 
the possibility that if several substances exist, the existence' of the 
one can follow reciprocally from the existence of the other (as an effect), 
and thus that because there is something in the former, there must 
B 293 on that account also be something in the other that cannot be understood 
from the existence of the latter alone? For this is requisite for 
community, but is not even comprehensible among things each of 
which is entirely isolated from the others through its subsistence. 
Hence Leibniz, who ascribed a community to the substances of the 
world only as conceived by the understanding alone, needed a divinity 
for mediation; for from their existence alone this community rightly 
seemed to him incomprehensible.92 But we can readily grasp the possibility 
of community (of substances as appearances) if we represent them 
in space, thus in outer intuition. For this already contains in itself a priori 
formal outer relations as conditions of the possibility of the real (in 
effect and countereffect, thus in community). -It can just as easily be 
established that the possibility of things as magnitudes, and thus the 
objective reality of the category of magnitude, can also be exhibited 
only in outer intuition, and that by means of that alone can it subsequently 
also be applied to inner sense. But in order to avoid being longwinded 
I must leave the examples of this to the reader's further thought.

The final conclusion of this entire section is thus: All principles of the

(Analytic of Principles) 
Third Chapter 
On the ground of the distinction of all objects 
in general into phenomena andnoumenaa,b 


We have now not only traveled through the land of pure understanding, 
and carefully inspected each part of it, but we have also surveyed it, 

a As in the first edition. For the second edition, Kant made extensive additions and some 
deletions in the body of this chapter prior to the appendix on the "Amphiboly of the 
Concepts of Reflection." We will present each version of the chapter up to the appendix 
in its entirety, repeating those passages that were not changed. The marginal pagination 
and notes will mark where the changes were made. 

b The following notes appear at the start of this chapter in Kant's copy of the first edition:

extend? If there is talk of a thing through categories that is determined merely through 
reason, hence also through categories, then such propositions are analytic, and yield no

"We can only think noumena, not cognize them." (E CVIl, p. 38; 23:34)

since this excludes all experience." (E CVIII, p. 39; 23:34) 
"Mundus phaenomenon or a whole of substances in space may readily be thought, but 
not as noumenon, since they are isolated." (E CIX, p. 39; 23:35)

"Categories do not serve to cognize things for themselves, but only to order intuitions 
in space and time, i.e., appearances." (E CX!, p. 39; 23:35) 

"Until now one believed that through categories one actually already cognized 
something; now we see that they are only forms of thought for bringing the manifold 
of intuitions to synthetic unity of apperception." (E CXII, p. 39; 23:35)

and determined the place for each thing in it.94 This land, however, is 
an island, and enclosed in unalterable boundaries by nature itself. It is 
the land of truth (a charming name), surrounded by a broad and stormy B 295 
ocean, the true seat of illusion, where many a fog bank and rapidly melting 
iceberg pretend to be new lands and, ceaselessly deceiving with A236 
empty hopes the voyager looking around for new discoveries, entwine 
him in adventures from which he can never escape and yet also never 
bring to an end. But before we venture out on this sea, to search 
through all its breadth and become certain of whether there is anything 
to hope for in it, it will be useful first to cast yet another glance at the 
map of the land that we would now leave, and to ask, first, whether we 
could not be satisfied with what it contains, or even must be satisfied 
with it out of necessity, if there is no other ground on which we could 
build; and, second, by what title we occupy even this land, and can hold 
it securely against all hostile claims. Although we have already adequately 
answered these questions in the course of the Analytic, a summary 
overview of their solutions can still strengthen conviction by 
unifying their various moments in one point. 

We have seen, namely, that everything that the understanding draws 
out of itself, without borrowing it from experience, it nevertheless has 
solely for the sake of use in experience. The principles of pure under-B 296 
standing, whether they are a priori constitutive (like the mathematical 
principles) or merely regulative (like the dynamical principles), contain 
nothing but only the pure schema, as it were, for possible experience; for A237 
this has its unity only from the synthetic unity that the understanding 
originally and from itself imparts to the synthesis of the imagination in 
relation to apperception, and in relationa to and agreement with which 
the appearances, as data for possible cognition, must already stand a priori. 
b But now even if these rules of the understanding are not only true 
a priori but are rather even the source of all truth, i.e., of the agreement 
of our cognition with objects,' in virtue of containing the ground of the 
possibility of experience, as the sum total of all cognition in which ob

jectsa may be given to us, still it does not seem enough to us merely to 
have expounded what is true, but also that which one has desired to 
know.b If, therefore, through this critical investigation we learn nothing 
more than what we should in any case have practiced in the merely empirical 
use of the understanding, even without such subtle inquiry, then 
it would seem the advantage that one will draw from it would hardly be 
worth the expense and preparation. Now to this, to be sure, one can 
reply that no curiosity is more disadvantageous to the expansion of our 
B 297 knowledge than that which would always know its utility in advance, 
before one has entered into the investigations, and before one could 
have the least concept of this utility even if it were placed before one's 
eyes. But there is one advantage, which can be made both comprehen


A238 sible and interesting to even the dullest and most reluctant student of 
such transcendental investigation, namely this: That the understanding 
occupied merely with its empirical use, which does not reflect on the 
sources of its own cognition, may get along very well, but cannot accomplish 
one thing, namely, determining for itself the boundaries of its 
use and knowing what may lie within and what without its whole sphere; 
for to this end the deep inquiries that we have undertaken are requisite. 
But if the understanding cannot distinguish whether certain questions 
lie within its horizon or not, then it is never sure of its claims and its 
possession, but must always reckon on many embarrassing corrections 
when it continually oversteps the boundaries of its territory (as is unavoidable) 
and loses itself in delusion and deceptions. 
That the understanding can therefore make only empirical use of all 
its a priori principles, indeed of all its concepts, but never transcendental 
use, is a proposition that, if it can be recognizedd with conviction, 

B 298 points to important consequences.' The transcendental use of a concept 
in any sort of principle consists in its being related to things in general 
and in themselves/ its empirical use, however, in its being related 

A239 merely to appearances, i.e., objects of a possible experience. But that 
it is only the latter that can ever take place is evident from the following. 
For every concept there is requisite, first, the logical form of a concept 
(of thinking) in general, and then, second, the possibility of giving 
it an object to which it is to be related. Without tllis latter it has no

sense, and is entirely empty of content, even though it may still contain 
the logical function for making a concept out of whatever sort of data 
there are. Now the object cannot be given to a concept otherwise than 
in intuition, and, even if a pure intuitiona is possible a priori prior to the 
object, then even this can acquire its object, thus its objective validity, 

only through empirical intuition, of which it is the mere form. Thus all 

concepts and with them all principles, however a priori they may be, are 
nevertheless related to empirical intuitions, i.e., to data for possible experience. 
Without this they have no objective validity at all, but are 
rather a mere play, whether it be with representations of the imagination 
or of the understanding. One need only take as an example the 
concepts of mathematics, and first, indeed, in their pure intuitions. B 299 
Space has three dimensions, between two points there can be only one 
straight line, etc. Although all these principles, and the representation 
of the object with which this science occupies itself, are generated in the A 240 
mind completely a priori, they would still not signify anything at all if 
we could not always exhibit their significance in appearances (empirical 
objects). Hence it is also requisite for one to make an abstract concept 
sensible, i.e., display the objectb that corresponds to it in intuition, 
since without this the concept would remain (as one says) without 
sense, i.e., without significance. Mathematics fulfills this requirement 
by means of the construction of the figure,c which is an appearance 
present to the senses (even though brought about a priori). In the same 
science, the concept of magnitude seeks its standing and sense in number, 
but seeks this in turn in the fingers, in the beads of an abacus, or in 

strokes and points that are placed before the eyes. The concept is always 

generated a priori, together with the synthetic principles or formulas 
from such concepts; but their use and relation to supposed objects can 
in the end be sought nowhere but in experience, the possibility of which 
(as far as its form is concerned) is contained in them a priori. 

That this is also the case with all categories, however, and the princi-B 300 
pIes spun out from them,d is also obvious from this: That we cannot 
even define a single one of them without immediately descending to 
conditions of sensibility, thus to the form of the appearances, to which, 
as their sole objects, they must consequently be limited, since, if one re-A 241 
moves this condition, all significance, i.e., relation to the object" disappears, 
and one cannot grasp through an example what sort of thing is

really intended by concepts of that sort.a Above, in the presentation of 
the table of the categories, we spared ourselves the definitions of each 
of them, on the ground that our aim, which pertains solely to their synthetic 
use, does not make that necessary, and one must not make oneself 
responsible for unnecessary undertakings that one can spare 
oneself. This was no excuse, but a not inconsiderable rule of prudence, 
not immediately to venture a definition and seek or pretend to completeness 
or precision in the determination of the concept if one can 
make do with one or another of its marks, without requiring a complete 
derivation of everything that constitutes the entire concept. But now it 
turns out that the ground of this precaution lies even deeper, namely, 
that we could not define them even if we wanted to, *, b but rather, if one 
A242 does away with all conditions of sensibility that distinguish them as concepts 
of a possible empirical use, and takes them for concepts of things 
in general (thus of transcendental use), then that is to do nothing more 
than to regard the logical functions of judgments as the condition of the 
possibility of things themselves, without in the least being able to show 
whence they could have their application and their object,c thus how in 
pure understanding without sensibility they could have any significance 
B 300 and objective validity. dNo one can define the concept of magnitude in 
general except by something like this: That it is the determination of a 
thing through which it can be thought how many units are posited in it. 
Only this how-many-times is grounded on successive repetition, thus 
on time and the synthesis (of the homogeneous) in it. Reality, in contrast 
to negation, can be defined only if one thinks of a time (as the sum 
total of all being) that is either filled by it or empty. If I leave out per-

A 241 * I mean here the real definition,' which does not merely supply other and more 
intelligible words for the name of a thing, but rather contains in itself a clear 
mark by means of which the object (definitum) can always be securely cog-

A 242 nized, and that makes the concept that is to be explained usable in application. 
A real definition! would therefore be that which does not merely make distinct 
a concept but at the same time its objective reality. Mathematical definitions, 
which exhibit the object in accordance with the concept in intuition, 
are of the latter sort.

sistence (which is existence at all times), then nothing is left in my concept 
of substance except the logical representation of the subject, which 
I try to realize by representing to myself something that can occur 
solely as subject (without being a predicate of anything). But then it is A243 
not only the case that I do not even know of any conditions under which B 301 
this logical preeminence can be attributed to any sort of thing;O it is also 
the case that absolutely nothing further is to be made of it, and not even 
the least consequence is to be drawn from it, because by its means no 
objectb whatever of the use of this concept is determined, and one 
therefore does not even know whether the latter means anything at all. 
From the concept of a cause as a pure category (ifrI leave out the time 
in which something follows something else in accordance with a rule), 
I will not find out anything more than that it is something that allows 
an inference to the existence of something else; and in that case not only 
would there be nothing through which cause and effect could be distinguished, 
but further, since the possibility of drawing this inference 
also requires conditions about which I would know nothing, the concept 
would not even have any determination through which to apply to 
any object.c The supposed principle "Everything contingent has a 
cause" steps forth rather gravely, as if it had its own dignity in itself. Yet 
if I ask what you mean by "contingent," and you answer, "that the notbeing 
of which is possible," then I would gladly know by what means 
you intend to cognize the possibility of this not-being, if you do not 
represent a succession in the series of appearances and in this succession 
an existence, which follows on the not-being (or conversely), and thus 
a change; for that the not-being of a thing does not contradict itself is A244 
a lame appeal to a logical condition, which is certainly necessary for the B 302 
concept but far from sufficient for real possibility; for I can suspend any 
existing substance in thought without contradicting myself, but I cannot 
at all infer from that to the objective contingency of its existence, 
i.e., the possibility of itsd not-being in itself. As far as the concept of 
community is concerned, it is easy to appreciate that since the pure categories 
of substance as well as causality do not admit of any definition 
determining the object,e reciprocal causality in the relation of substances 
to each other (commercium) will be just as little susceptible of it. 
No one has ever been able to define possibility, existence, and necessity 
except through obvious tautologies if he wanted to draw their definition 
solely from the pure understanding. For the deception of substituting

the logical possibility of the concept (since it does not contradict itself) 
for the transcendentala possibility of things (where an object corresponds 
to the concept) can deceive and satisfy only the inexperienced.b 

eThere is something strange and even nonsensical in there being a 
concept that must have some significance but is not capable of definition. 
Only in the case of the categories is there this special circum


A245 stance, that they can have a determinate significance and relation to 
any object only by means of the general sensible condition, but that 
this condition is omitted from the pure category, since this can contain 
nothing but the logical function for bringing the manifold under a 
concept. From this function, i.e., the form of the concept alone, however, 
nothing can be cognized and distinguished about which objectd 
belongs under it, since abstraction has been made from just the sensible 
condition under which objects can belong under it at all. Hence the 
categories require, beyond the pure concept of the understanding, determinations 
of their application to sensibility in general (schema), and 
without these are not concepts through which an object can be cognized 
and distinguished from others, but only so many ways of thinking 
of an object for possible intuitions and of giving it its significance 
in accordance with some function of the understanding (under the requisite 
conditions), i.e., of defining it: they themselves cannot therefore 
be defined. The logical functions of judgment in generalr-unity 
and multiplicity, affirmation and negation, subject and predicate -cannot 
be defined without falling into a circle, since the definition would 
itself have to be a judgment and therefore already contain these functions 
of judgment and therefore already contain these functions. The 
pure categories, however, are nothing other than the representations 
of things in general insofar as the manifold of their intuition must be 
thought through one or another of these logical functions: Magnitude 
is the determination that must be thought only through a judgment 
that has quantity (judicium communee); reality, that which can be 
thought only through an affirmative judgment; substance, that which, 
in relation to the intuition, must be the ultimate subject of all other 
determinations. But now what sorts of things those are in regard to 
which one must use one function rather than another remains hereby 
entirely undetermined: thus without the condition of sensible intuition, 
the synthesis of which they contain, the categories have no relation 
at all to any determinate object,! thus they cannot define one, and

consequently they do not have in themselves any validity of objective 
concepts. 

aNow from this it follows irrefutably that the pure concepts of the B 303 
understanding can never be of transcendental, but always only of empirical 
use,b and that the principles of pure understanding can be related 
to objects of the senses only in relation to the general conditions 
of a possible experience, but never to things in generale (without taking 
regard of the way in which we might intuit them).d 

The Transcendental Analytic accordingly has this important result: 
That the understanding can never accomplish a priori anything more 
than to anticipate the form of a possible experience in general, and, 
since that which is not appearance cannot be an object of experience, it 
can never overstep the limits of sensibility, within which alone objects 
are given to us. Its principles are merely principles e of the exposition of A 247 
appearances, and the proud name of an ontology, which presumes to 
offer synthetic a priori cognitions of things in general in a systematic 
doctrine (e.g., the principle of causality), must give way to the modest 
one of a mere analytic of the pure understanding. 

Thinking is the action of relating given intuitions to an object. If the B 304 
manner of this intuition is not given in any way, then the object is 
merely transcendental, and the concept of the understanding has none 
other than a transcendental use, namely the unity of thought of a manifold! 
in general. Now through a pure category, in which abstraction is 
made from any condition of sensible intuition as the only one that is 
possible for us, no objectg is determined/' rather only the thought of an 
objecti in general is expressed in accordance with different modi. Now 
to the use of a concept there also belongs a function of the power of 
judgment, whereby an object is subsumed under it, thus at least the formal 
condition under which something can be given in intuition. If this 
condition of the power of judgment (schema) is missing, then all subsumption 
disappears; for nothing would be given that could be subsumed 
under the concept. The merely transcendental use of the cate

gories is thus in fact no use at alV and has no determinate or even, as 

A248 far as its form is concerned, determinable object. From this it also follows 
that the pure category does not suffice for any synthetic a priori 
principle, and that the principles of the pure understanding are only of 
empirical but never of transcendental use; but nowhere beyond the field 

B 305 of possible experience can there be any synthetic a priori principles. 

It may therefore be advisable to express ourselves thus: The pure categories, 
without formal conditions of sensibility, have merely transcendental 
significance, but are not of any transcendental use, since this is 
impossible in itself, for they are lacking all conditions of any use (in 
judgments), namely the formal condition of the subsumption of any 
sort of supposed object under these concepts. Thus since (as merely 
pure categories) they are not supposed to have empirical use, and cannot 
have transcendental use, they do not have any use at all if they are 
separated from all sensibility, i.e., they cannot be applied to any supposed 
object at all; rather they are merely the pure form of the use of 
the understanding in regard to objects in general and of thinking, yet 
without any sort of objectb being able to be thought or determined 
through them alone.c

The following notes are inserted in Kant's copy of the first edition at A 248, presumably 
drafts of the changes that were to be made at this point in the second edition: 

"One can give the possibility of a thing only through intuition, either empirical or 
a priori intuition. lhe former is empirical, the latter at least sensible. Both therefore 
pertain to phaenomena. No theoretical cognition of noumenon at all, but practical relation 
to a subject, insofar as it is not phaenomenon." (E CXXVIII, p. 42; 23: 3 5-6) 

"If something is found, not to be sure in the sensible world, but yet in our pure 
consciousness of reason, which is absolutely contrary to laws of the former, e.g., that 

of causality, then we belong to the noumenon, but can have to that extent no knowledge 
of ourselves, but yet can at least concede the possibility of it." (E CXXIX, p. 42; 
23'36) 

"Beings of understanding are properly those to which nothing but intellectual intuition 
corresponds. Now since our understanding is not able to intuit, this intellectual intuition 
is nothing for us. Thus nothing is left for us but concepts of the understanding. 
But these are merely forms of thought, so that if one would apply them alone to an object 
[Object], without an example for sensible intuition that something can correspond 
to them, they cannot be comprehended at all." (E CXXX, p. 42; 23:36) 

"Objects of a non-sensible intuition are either given in a sensible intuition or not. If 
the first, then they are certainly appearances, but one cannot know whether they could 
be cognized in some other way, and whether intellectual intuition is possible. Since I 
have no intellectual intuition, I cannot even cognize the possibility of objects that cannot 
be given in any sensible intuition at all, and objects of an intuition of the understanding 
would be mere problematical beings, and all noumena or beings of the 
understanding are to be regarded as such. N.B." (E CXXXI, pp. 42-3; 23:36) 

346 



Chapter III. On the Ground of the Distinction <A> 
aAppearances, to the extent that as objects they are thought in accordance 
with the unity of the categories, are called phaenomena. If, A249 
however, I suppose there to be things that are merely objects of the understanding 
and that, nevertheless, can be given to an intuition, although 
not to sensible intuition (as coram intuiti intellectuali),b then 
such things would be called noumena (intelligibilia). 
Now one might have thought that the concept of appearances, limited 
by the Transcendental Aesthetic, already yields by itself the objective 
reality of the noumenaC and justifies the division of objects into 
phenomena and noumena, thus also the division of the world into a world 
of the senses and of the understanding (mundus sensibilis & intelligibilis), 
indeed in such a way that the difference here would not concern merely 
the logical form of the indistinct or distinct cognition of one and the 
same thing, but rather the difference between how they can originally 
be given to our cognition, in accordance with which they are in themselves 
different species. For if the senses merely represent something to 
us as it appears, then this something must also be in itself a thing, and 
an object of a non-sensible intuition, i.e., of the understanding, i.e., a 
cognition must be possible in which no sensibility is encountered, and 
which alone has absolutely objective reality, through which, namely, 
objects are represented to us as they are, in contrast to the empirical 
use of our understanding, in which things are only cognized as they A 2 50 
appear. Thus there would be, in addition to the empirical use of the 
categories (which is limited to sensible conditions), a pU_'e and yet objectively 
valid one, and we could not assert, what we have previously 
maintained, that our pure cognitions of the understanding are in general 
nothing more than principlesd of the expositione of appearances 
that do not go a priori beyond the formal possibility of experience, for 
here an entirely different field would stand open before us, as it were a 
world thought in spirit (perhaps also even intuited), which could not 
less but even more nobly occupy our understanding. 
All our representations are in fact related to some object! through 
the understanding, and, since appearances are nothing but representa"
We have seen at the end of the Principles that the concept of causality serves to determine 
the relation [Verhaltnis] of the temporal sequence in the course of its appearances 
a priori; if we take time away, then it is for nothing." (E CXXXII, p. 43; 23:36)

tions, the understanding thus relates them to a something, as the object 
of sensible intuition: but this something a is to that extent only the 
transcendental object.b This signifies, however a something = X, of 
which we know nothing at all nor can know anything in general (in accordance 
with the current constitution of our understanding), but is 
rather something that can serve only as a correlate of the unity of apperception 
for the unity of the manifold in sensible intuition, by means 
of which the understanding unifies that in the concept of an object. 
This transcendental objectC cannot even be separated from the sensible 

A251 data, for then nothing would remain through which it would be 
thought. It is therefore no object of cognition in itself, but only the representation 
of appearances under the concept of an object in general, 
which is determinable through the manifold of those appearances.d,95 
Just for this reason, then, the categories do not represent any special 
objecte given to the understanding alone, but rather serve only to determine 
the transcendental object! (the concept of something in general) 
through that which is given in sensibility, in order thereby to 
cognize appearances empirically under concepts of objects. 
But the cause on account of which, not yet satisfied through the substratum 
of sensibility, one must add noumena that only the pure understanding 
can think to the phaenomena, rests solely on this. Sensibility 
and its field, namely that of appearances, are themselves limited by the 
understanding, in that they do not pertain to things in themselves, but 
only to the way in which, on account of our subjective constitution, 
things appear to us. This was the result of the entire Transcendental 
Aesthetic, and it also follows naturally from the concept of an appearance 
in general that something must correspond to it which is not in itself 
appearance, for appearance can be nothing for itself and outside of 

A252 our kind of representation; thus, if there is not to be a constant circle, 
the word "appearance" must already indicate a relation to something 
the immediate representation of which is, to be sure, sensible, but 
which in itself, without this constitution of our sensibility (on which the 
form of our intuition is grounded), must be something, i.e., an object 
independent of sensibility. 
Now from this arisesg the concept of a noumenon, which, however, is

not at all positive and does not signify a determinate cognition of any 
sort of thing, but rather only the thinking of something in general, in 
which I abstract from all form of sensible intuition. But in order for a 
noumenona to signify a true object, to be distinguished from all phenomena,
b it is not enough that I liberate my thoughts from all conditions 
of sensible intuition, but I must in addition have ground to 
assume another kind of intuition than this sensible one, under which 
such an object could be given; for otherwise my thought is empty, even 
though free of contradiction. To be sure, above we were able to prove 
not that sensible intuition is the only possible intuition, but rather that 
it is the only one possible for us; but we also could not prove that yet 
another kind of intuition is possible, and, although our thinking can abstract 
from that sensibility, the question still remains whether it is not 
then a mere form of a concept and whether any object' at all is left over A253 
after this separation.d 

The objecte to which I relate appearance in general is the transcendental 
object, i.e., the entirely undetermined thought of something in 
general. This cannot be called the noumenon;ffor I do not know anything 
about what it is in itself, and have no concept of it except merely 
that of the object of a sensible intuition in general, which is therefore 
the same for all appearances. I cannot think it through any categories; 
for these hold of empirical intuition, in order to bring it under a concept 
of the object in general. To be sure, a pure use of the category is 
possible/ i.e., without contradiction, but it has no objective validity, 
since it pertains to no intuition that would thereby acquire unity of the 
object;h for the category is a mere function of thinking, through which 
no object is given to me, but rather only that through which what may 
be given in intuition is thought.

cognition, then no cognition of any object at all remains; for through 
mere intuition nothing at all is thought, and that this affection of sensibility 
is in me does not constitute any relation of such representation 
to any objecta at all. But if, on the contrary, I leave out all intuition, 

A254 then there still remains the form of thinking, i.e., the way of determining 
an object for the manifold of a possible intuition. Hence to this extent 
the categories extend further than sensible intuition, since they 
think objectsb in general without seeing to the particular manner (of 
sensibility) in which they might be given. But they do not thereby determine 
a greater sphere of objects, since one cannot assume that such 
objects can be given without presupposing that another kind of intuition 
than the sensible kind is possible, which, however, we are by no 
means justified in doing. 

Bo310 I call a concept problematic that contains no contradiction but that is 
also, as a boundary for given concepts, connected with other cognitions, 
the objective reality of which can in no way be cognized. The concept 
of a noumenon,c i.e., of a thing that is not to be thought of as an object 
of the senses but rather as a thing in itself (solely through a pure understanding), 
is not at all contradictory; for one cannot assert of 
sensibility that it is the only possible kind of intuition. Further, this concept 
is necessary in order not to extend sensible intuition to things in 
themselves, and thus to limit the objective validity of sensible cognition 

A 2 55 (for the other things, to which sensibility does not reach, are called 
noumenad just in order to indicate that those cognitions cannot extend 
their domain to everything that the understanding thinks). In the end, 
however, we have no insight into the possibility of such noumena,e and 
the domain outside of the sphere of appearances is empty (for us), i.e., 
we have an understanding that extends farther than sensibility problematically, 
but no intuition, indeed not even the concept of a possible 
intuition, through which objects outside of the field of sensibility could 
be given, and about which the understanding could be employed assertorically. 
The concept of a noumenonfis therefore merely a bound-


B 3 I I ary concept, in order to limit the pretension of sensibility, and 
therefore only of negative use. But it is nevertheless not invented arbitrarily, 
but is rather connected with the limitation of sensibility, yet 
without being able to posit anything positive outside of the domain of 
the latter.

world into a world of sense and a world of understanding, can therefore 
not be permitted at all, although concepts certainly permit of division 
into sensible and intellectual ones; for one cannot determine any object 
for the latter, and therefore also cannot pass them off as objectively 
valid. If one abandons the senses, how will one make comprehensible 
that our categories (which would be the only remaining concepts for A 2 56 
noumena)a still signify anything at all, since for their relation to anyrobject 
something more than merely the unity of thinking must be given, 
namely a possible intuition, to which they can be applied? Nevertheless 
the concept of a noumenon,b taken merely problematically, remains not 
only admissible, but even unavoidable, as a concept setting limits to 
sensibility. But in that case it is not a special intelligible object for our 
understanding; rather an understanding to which it would belong is itself 
a problem, namely, that of cognizing its object not discursively 
through categories but intuitively in a non-sensible intuition, the possi-B 3 12 
bility of which we cannot in the least represent. Now in this way our 
understanding acquires a negative expansion, i.e., it is not limited by 
sensibility, but rather limits it by calling things in themselves (not considered 
as appearances) noumena. But it also immediately sets boundaries 
for itself, not cognizing these things through categories, hence 
merely thinking them under the name of an unknown something. 

Yet I find in the writings of the moderns an entirely different use of 
the expressions of a mundi sensibilis and intelligibilis,< which entirely diverges 
from the sense of the ancients, which is not itself a problem, but A257 
which is also nothing but an empty trafficking with words. In accordance 
with this usage some have been pleased to call the sum total of appearances, 
so far as it is intuited, the world of sense, but the connectiond of 
them insofar as it is thought in accordance with general laws of the understanding, 
the world of understanding. Theoretical astronomy, which B 3 1 3 
expounds the mere observation of the starry heavens, would be the former, 
contemplative astronomy on the contrary (explained, say, according 
to the Copernican world-system or even according to Newton's laws of 
gravitation) would be the latter, making an intelligible world representable. 
But such a perversion of words is a merely sophistical evasion 
for escaping from a difficult question by reducing its sense to a commonplace. 
WIth regard to appearances, to be sure, both understanding 
and reason can be used; but it must be asked whether they would still 
have any use if the object were not appearance (noumenon), and one takes 
it in this sense if one thinks of it as merely intelligible, i.e., as given to 

a Not in roman type.
b Here Kant uses the Latin singular genitive Noumeni. 
, "sensible and intelligible worlds." At this point the second edition adds a note; see B 312.

the understanding alone and not to the senses at all. The question is 
thus: whether beyond the empirical use of the understanding (even in 
the Newtonian representation of the cosmos) a transcendental one is 
also possible, pertaining to the noumenono as an object -which question 
we have answered negatively. 

A 2 58 If, therefore, we say: The senses represent objects to us as they appear, 
but the understanding, as they are, then the latter is not to be 
taken in a transcendental but in a merely empirical way, signifying, 
namely, how they must be represented as objects of experience, in the 

B 314 thoroughgoing connectionb of appearances, and not how they might 
be outside of the relation to possible experience and consequently to 
sense in general, thus as objects of pure understanding. For this will always 
remain unknown to us, so that it even remains unknown to us, so 
that it even remains unknown whether such a transcendental (extraordinary) 
cognition is possible at all, at least as one that stands under our 
customary categories. With us understanding and sensibility can determine 
an object only in combination. If we separate them, then we 
have intuitions without concepts, or concepts without intuitions, but in 
either case representations that we cannot relate to any determinate 
object. 
If after all this discussion anyone still has reservations about denying 
the categories a merely transcendental use, then he should test them in 
any synthetic assertion. For an analytic one takes the understanding no 
further, and since it is occupied only with that which is already thought 
in the concept, it leaves it undecided whether the concept even has any 


A259 relation to objects, or only signifies the unity of thinking in general 
(which entirely abstracts from the way in which an object might be 
given); it is enough for him to know what lies in its concept; what the 
concept might pertain to is indifferent to him. He should accordingly 

B 3 I 5 test it with some synthetic and allegedly transcendental principle, such 
as: "Everything that is, exists as substance, or a determination dependent 
on it," "Everything contingent exists as the effect of another thing, 
namely its cause," etc. Now I ask: Whence will he derive these synthetic 
propositions, since the concepts are not to hold of possible experience 
but rather of things in themselves (noumena)? Where is the third thingC 
that is always requisite for a synthetic proposition in order to connect 
with each other concepts that have no logical (analytical) affinity? He 
will never prove his proposition, indeed, what is more, he will not even 
be able to justify the possibility of such a pure assertion, without taking 
account of the empirical use of the understanding, and thereby entirely

On the ground of the distinaion of all objeas

We have now not only traveled through the land of pure understanding, 
and carefully inspected each part of it, but we have also surveyed it, 
and determined the place for each thing in it. But this land is an island, 
and enclosed in unalterable boundaries by nature itself. It is the land of 
B 295 truth (a charming name), surrounded by a broad and stormy ocean, the 
true seat of illusion, where many a fog bank and rapidly melting iceberg 

A236 pretend to be new lands and, ceaselessly deceiving with empty hopes 
the voyager looking around for new discoveries, entwine him in adventures 
from which he can never escape and yet also never bring to an 
end. But before we venture out on this sea, to search through all its 
breadth and become certain of whether there is anything to hope for in 
it, it will be useful first to cast yet another glance at the map of the land 
that we would now leave, and to ask, first, whether we could not be satisfied 
with what it contains, or even must be satisfied with it out of necessity, 
if there is no other ground on which we could build; and, 
second, by what title we occupy even this land, and can hold it securely 
against all hostile claims. Although we have already adequately answered 
these questions in the course of the Analytic, a summary 
overview of their solutions can still strengthen conviction by unifying 
their various moments in one point.

out of itself, without borrowing it from experience, it nevertheless has 
solely for the sake of use in experience. The principles of pure under-B 296 
standing, whether they are a priori constitutive (like the mathematical 
principles) or merely regulative (like the dynamical principles), contain 
nothing but only the pure schema, as it were, for possible experience; A237 
for this has its unity only from the synthetic unity that the understanding 
originally and from itself imparts to the synthesis of the imagination 
in relation to apperception, and in relation to and agreement 
with which the appearances, as data for possible cognition, must already 
stand a priori. But now even if these rules of the understanding 
are not only true a priori but are rather even the source of all truth, i.e., 
of the agreement of our cognition with objects,a in virtue of containing 
the ground of the possibility of experience, as the sum total of all cognition 
in which objects b may be given to us, still it does not seem 
enough to us merely to have expounded what is true, but also that 
which one has desired to know. If, therefore, through this critical investigation 
we learn nothing more than what we should in any case 
have practiced in the merely empirical use of the understanding, even 
without such subtle inquiry, then it would seem that the advantage that 
one will draw from it would hardly be worth the expense and preparation. 
Now to this, to be sure, one can reply that no curiosity is more 
disadvantageous to the expansion of our knowledgeC than that which 
would always know its utility in advance, before one has entered into B 297 
the investigations, and before one could have the least concept of this 
utility even if it were placed before one's eyes. But there is one advantage, 
which can be made both comprehensible and interesting to even A238 
the dullest and most reluctant student of such transcendental investigation, 
namely this: That the understanding occupied merely with its 
empirical use, which does not reflect on the sources of its own cognition, 
may get along very well, but cannot accomplish one thing, 
namely, determining for itself the boundaries of its use and knowing 
what may lie within and what without its whole sphere; for to this end 
the deep inquiries that we have undertaken are requisite. But if the understanding 
cannot distinguish whether certain questions lie within its 
horizon or not, then it is never sure of its claims and its possession, but 
must always reckon on many embarrassing corrections when it continually 
oversteps the boundaries of its territory (as is unavoidable) and 
loses itself in delusion and deceptions. 

That the understanding can therefore make only empirical use of all 
its a priori principles, indeed of all its concepts, but never transcenden

tal use, is a proposition that, if it be recognizeda with conviction, 
points to important transcendental use of a concept 
in any sort of principle consists in its being related to things in general 
and in themselves; its empirical use, however, in its being related 
merely to appearances, i.e., objects of a possible experienc􀀶But that 
it is only the latter that can ever take place is evident from the following. 
For every concept there is requisite, first, the logical form of a concept 
(of thinking) in general, and then, second, the possibility of giving 
it an object to which it is to be related. Without this latter it has no 
sense, and is entirely empty of content, even though it may still contain 
the logical function for making a concept out of whatever sort of data 
there are. Now the object cannot be given to a concept othenvise than 
in intuition, and, even if a pure intuition is possible a priori prior to the 
object, then even this can acquire its object, thus its objective validity, 
only through empirical intuition, of which it is the mere form. Thus all 
concepts and with them all principles, however a priori they may be, are 
nevertheless related to empirical intuitions, i.e., to data for possible experience. 
Without this they have no objective validity at all, but are 
rather a mere play, whether it be with representations of the imagination 
or of the understanding. One need only take as an example the 

A239 
B299 concepts of mathematics, and first, indeed, in their pure intuitions. 
Space has three dimensions, between two points there can be only one 
straight line, etc. Although all these principles, and the representation 
of the object with which this science occupies itself, are generated in the 
mind completely a priori, they would still not signify anything at all if 
we could not always exhibit their significance in appearances (empirical 
objects). Hence it is also requisite for one to make an abstract concept 
sensible, i.e., to display the objectb that corresponds to it in intuition, 
since without this the concept would remain (as one says) without sense, 
i.e., without significance. Mathematics fulfills this requirement by means 
of the construction of the figure,' which is an appearance present to the 
senses (even though brought about a priori). In the same science the 
concept of magnitude seeks its standing and sense in number, but seeks 
this in turn in the fingers, in the beads of an abacus, or in strokes and 
points that are placed before the eyes. The concept is always generated 
a priori, together with the synthetic principles or formulas from such 
concepts; but their use and relation to supposed objects can in the end 
be sought nowhere but in experience, the possibility of which (as far as 
its form is concerned) is contained in them a priori. 
That this is also the case with all categories, however, and the princi

Phenomena and /l.lournena <B> 

pIes spun out from them, is also obvious from this: That we cannot even 
give a real definition of a single one of them, i.e., make intelligible the 
possibility of their object,a without immediately descending to conditions 
of sensibility, thus to the form of the appearances, to which, as 
their sole objects, they must consequently be limited, since, if one re-A241 
moves this condition, all significance, i.e., relation to the object,b disappears, 
and one cannot grasp through an example what sort of thing is 
really intended by concepts of that sort. C 

liNo one can define the concept of magnitude in general except by A242 
something like this: That it is the determination of a thing through 
which it can be thought how many units are posited in it. Only this 
how-many-times is grounded on successive repetition, thus on time and 
the synthesis (of the homogeneous) in it. Reality, in contrast to negation, 
can only be defined if one thinks of a time (as the sum total of all 
being) that is either filled by it or empty. If I leave out persistence 
(which is existence at all times), then nothing is left in my concept of 
substance except the logical representation of the subject, which I try to 
realize by representing to myself something that can occur solely as 
subject (without being a predicate of anything). But then it is not only A 243 
the case that I do not even know of any conditions under which this log-B 30r 
ical preeminence can be attributed to any sort of thing; it is also the case 
that absolutely nothing further is to be made of it, and not even the least 
consequence is to be drawn from it, because by its means no objecte 
whatever of the use of this concept is determined, and one therefore 
does not even know whether the latter means anything at all. From the 
concept of a cause as a pure category (if I leave out the time in which 
something follows something else in accordance with a rule), I will not 
find out anything more than that it is something that allows an inference 
to the existence of something else; and in that case not only would 
there be nothing through which cause and effect could be distinguished, 
but further, since the possibility of drawing this inference also 
requires conditions about which I would know nothing, the concept 
would not even have any determination through which to apply to any 
object! The supposed principle "Everything contingent has a cause" 
steps forth rather gravely, as if it had its own dignity in itself. Yet if I ask 
what you mean by "contingent," and you answer, "that the not-being of 
which is possible," then I would gladly know by what means you intend 
to cognize the possibility of this not-being, if you do not represent a

succession in the series of appearances and in this succession an exis


tence, which follows on the not-being (or conversely), and thus a 
A244 change; for that the not-being of a thing does not contradict itself is a 
B 302 lame appeal to a logical condition, which is certainly necessary for the 

concept but far from sufficient for real possibility; for I can suspend any 
existing substance in thought without contradicting myself, but I cannot 
at all infer from that to the objective contingency of its existence, 
i.e., the possibility of itsa not-being in itself. As far as the concept of 
community is concerned, it is easy to appreciate that since the pure categories 
of substance as well as causality do not admit of any definition 
determining the object,b reciprocal causality in the relation of substances 
to each other (commercium) will be just as little susceptible of it. 
No one has ever been able to define possibility, existence, and necessity 
except through obvious tautologies ifhe wanted to draw their definition 
solely from the pure understanding. For the deception of substituting 
the logical possibility of the concept (since it does not contradict itself) 
for the transcendental possibility of things (where an object corresponds 
to the concept) can deceive and satisfy only the inexperienced.*'c 

A246/B 303 Now from this it follows irrefutably that the pure concepts of the understanding 
can never be of transcendental, but always only of empirical 
use, and that the principles of pure understanding can be related 
to objects of the senses only in relation to the general conditions of a 
possible experience, but never to things in general (without taking regard 
of the way in which we might intuit them). 
The Transcendental Analytic accordingly has this important result: 
That the understanding can never accomplish a priori anything more 
than to anticipate the form of a possible experience in general, and, 
since that which is not appearance cannot be an object of experience, it 
can never overstep the limits of sensibility, within which alone objects 
A 247 are given to us. Its principles are merely principlesd of the exposition of 
appearances, and the proud name of an ontology, which presumes to

doctrine (e.g., the principle of causality), must give way to the modest 
one of a mere analytic of the pure understanding. 

Thinking is the action of relating given intuitions to an object. If the B 304 
manner of this intuition is not given in any way, then the object is 
merely transcendental, and the concept of the understanding has none 
other than a transcendental use, namely the unity of thought of a manifold 
in general. Now through a pure category, in which abstraction is 
made from any condition of sensible intuition as the only one that is 
possible for us, no objecta is determined, rather only the thought of an 
objectb in general is expressed in accordance with different modi. Now 
to the use of a concept there also belongs a function of the power of 
judgment, whereby an object is subsumed under it, thus at least the formal 
condition under which something can be given in intuition. If this 
condition of the power of judgment (schema) is missing, then all subsumption 
disappears; for nothing would be given that could be subsumed 
under the concept. The merely transcendental use of the categories 
is thus in fact no use at all, and has no determinate or even, as far 
as its form is concerned, determinable object. From this it also follows A248 
that the pure category does not suffice for any synthetic a priori principle, 
and that the principles of the pure understanding are only of empirical 
but never of transcendental use; but nowhere beyond the field of 
possible experience can there be any synthetic a priori principles. B 305 

It may therefore be advisable to express ourselves thus: The pure categories, 
without formal conditions of sensibility, have merely transcendental 
significance, but are not of any transcendental use, since this is 
impossible in itself, for they are lacking all conditions of any use (in 
judgments), namely the formal conditions of the subsumption of any 
sort of supposed object under these concepts. Thus since (as merely 
pure categories) they are not supposed to have empirical use, and cannot 
have transcendental use, they do not have any use at all if they are 
separated from all sensibility, i.e., they cannot be applied to any supposed 
object at all; rather they are merely the pure form of the employment 
of the understanding in regard to objects in general and of 
thinking, yet without any sort of objectC being able to be thought or determined 
through them alone.

they therefore seem to allow an application extended beyond all objects 
of the senses. But for their part they are in turn nothing other than 
forms of thought, which contain merely the logical capacity a for uni-
B 306 fying the manifold given in intuition in a consciousness a priori; thus if 
one takes away from them the only sensible intuition possible for us, 
they have even less significance than those pure sensible forms, through 
which at least an objectb is given, whereas a kind of combination of the 
manifold that is proper to our understanding signifies nothing at all if 
that intuition in which alone the manifold can be given is not added to 
ig-Nevertheless, if we call certain objects, as appearances, beings of 
sense (pbaenomena), because we distinguish the way in which we intuit 
them from their constitution in itself, then it already follows from our 
concept that to these we as it were oppose, as objects thought merely 
through the understanding, either other objects conceived in accordance 
with the latter constitution, even though we do not intuit it in 
them, or else other possible things, which are not objects c of our senses 
at all, and call these beings of understanding (noumena). Now the question 
arises: Whether our pure concepts of understanding do not have 
significance in regard to the latter, and whether they could be a kind of 
cognition of them? 

But right at the outset here there is an ambiguity, which can occasion 
great misunderstanding: Since the understanding, when it calls an object 
in a relation mere phenomenon,d simultaneously makes for itself, 
beyond this relation, another representation of an object in itself and 
B 307 hence also represents itself as being able to make concepts of such an 
object, and since the understanding offers nothing other than the cate



could cognize through the understanding in some way. 

If by a noumenone we understand a thing insofar as it is not an object! 
of our sensible intuition, because we abstract from the manner 
of our intuition of it, then this is a noumenon in the negative sense.g

then we assume a special kind of intuition, namely intellectual intuition, 
which, however, is not our own, and the possibility of which we cannot 
understand, and this would be the noumenon in a positive sense.a 
Now the doctrine of sensibility is at the same time the doctrine of the 
noumenon in the negative sense, i.e., of things that the understanding 
must think without this relation to our kind of intuition, thus not 
merely as appearances but as things in themselves, but about which, 
however, it also understands that in this abstractionb it cannot consider B 308 
making any use of its categories, since they have significance only in relation 
to the unity of intuitions in space and time, and can even determine 
this unity a priori through general concepts of combination only 
on account of the mere ideality of space and time. Where this temporal 
unity cannot be encountered, thus in the case of the noumenon, 
there the entire use, indeed even all significance of the categories completely 
ceases; for then we could not have insight even into the possibility 
of the things that would correspond to the categories; on this 
score I need only appeal to that which I adduced right at the beginning 
of the general remark to the previous chapter.96 Now, however, the possibility 
of a thing can never be proved merely through the non-contradictoriness 
of a concept of it, but only by vouching for it with an 
intuition corresponding to this concept. If, therefore, we wanted to 
apply the categories to objects that are not considered as appearances, 
then we would have to ground them on an intuition other than the sensible 
one, and then the object would be a noumenon in a positive 
sense. c Now since such an intuition, namely intellectual intuition, lies 
absolutely outside our faculty of cognition, the use of the categories can 
by no means reach beyond the boundaries of the objects of experience; 
and although beings of understanding certainly correspond to the beings 
of sense, and there may even be beings of understanding to which B 309 
our sensible faculty of intuition has no relation at all, our concepts of 
understanding, as mere forms of thought for our sensible intuition, do 
not reach these in the least; thus that which we call noumenon must be 
understood to be such only in a negative sense .d> 
eIf I take all thinking (through categories) away from an empirical A253 
cognition, then no cognition of any object at all remains; for through 
mere intuition nothing at all is thought, and that this affection of sensibility 
is in me does not constitute any relation of such representation

to any objecta at all. But if, on the contrary, I leave out all intuition, then 

A254 there still remains the form of thinking, i.e., the way of determining an 
object for the manifold of a possible intuition. Hence to this extent the 
categories extend further than sensible intuition, since they think objectsb 
in general without seeing to the particular manner (of sensibility) 
in which they might be given. But they do not thereby determine a 
greater sphere of objects, since one cannot assume that such objects can 
be given without presupposing that another kind of intuition than the 
sensible kind is possible, which, however, we are by no means justified 
in doing. 

B 3 10 I call a concept problematic that contains no contradiction but that is 
also, as a boundary for given concepts, connected with oths;:r cognitions, 
the objective reality of which can in no way be cognized.[rhe concept 
of a noumenon,C i.e., of a thing that is not to be thought of as an object 
of the senses but rather as a thing in itsel􀀋(solely through a pure understanding), 
is not at all contradictory; for one cannot assert of 
sensibility that it is the only possible kind of intuition. Further, this concept 
is necessary in order not to extend sensible intuition to things in 
themselves, and thus to limit the objective validity of sensible cognition 

A 2 55 (for the other things, to which sensibility does not reach, are called 
noumenad just in order to indicate that those cognitions cannot extend 
their domain to everything that the understanding thinks). In the end, 
however, we have no insight into the possibility of such noumena,e and 
the domain outside of the sphere of appearances is empty (for us), i.e., 
we have an understanding that extends farther than sensibility problematically, 
but no intuition, indeed not even the concept of a possible 
intuition, through which objects outside of the field of sensibility could 
be given, and about which the understanding could be employed assertorically. 
The concept of a noumenonf is therefore merely a 

B 3 I I boundary concept, in order to limit the pretension of sensibility, and 
therefore only of negative use. But it is nevertheless not invented arbitrarily, 
but is rather connected with the limitation of sensibility, yet 
without being able to posit anything positive outside of the domain of 
the latter. 
The division of objects into phaenomena and noumena, and of the 
world into a world of sense and a world of understanding, can therefore 
not be permitted at all <in a positive sense>,g although concepts cer

tainly permit of division into sensible and intellectual ones; for one cannot 
determine any object for the latter, and therefore also cannot pass 
them off as objectively valid. If one abandons the senses, how will one 
make comprehensible that our categories (which would be the only re-A2S6 
maining concepts for noumena)a still signify anything at all, since for 
their relation to any object something more than merely the unity of 
thinking must be given, namely a possible intuition, to which they can 
be applied? Nevertheless the concept of a noumenon,b taken merely 
problematically, remains not only admissible, but even unavoidable, as 
a concept setting limits to sensibility. But in that case it is not a special 
intelligible object for our understanding; rather an understanding to 
which it would belong is itself a problem, that, namely, of cognizing its 
object not discursively through categories but intuitively in a non-B3I2 
sensible intuition, the possibility of which we cannot in the least represent. 
Now in this way our understanding acquires a negative expansion, 
i.e., it is not limited by sensibility, but rather limits it by calling things 
in themselves (not considered as appearances) noumena. But it also immediately 
sets boundaries for itself, not cognizing these things through 
categories, hence merely thinking them under the name of an unknown 
something. 

Yet I find in the writings of the moderns an entirely different use of 
the expressions of a mundi sensibilis and intelligibilis, *,c which entirely diverges 
from the sense of the ancients, which is not itself a problem, but A2S7 
which is also nothing but empty trafficking with words. In accordance 
with this usage some have been pleased to call the sum total of appearances, 
so far as it is intuited, the world of sense, but the connectiond of 
them insofar as it is thought in accordance with general laws of the understanding, 
the world of understanding. Theoretical astronomy, which B 3 I 3 
expounds the mere observation of the starry heavens, would be the former, 
contemplative astronomy on the contrary (explained, say, according 
to the Copernican world-system or even according to Newton's 
laws of gravitation) would be the latter, making an intelligible world 

* <In place of this expression one must not use that of an intellectualworld, as B 3 12 
is customary in German; for only cognitions are intellectual or sensitive. But 
that which can only be an object of the one mode of intuition or the other, 
the objectse therefore, must be called intelligible or sensible (regardless of how 
harsh it sounds).>

representable. But such a perversion of words is a merely sophistical 
evasion for escaping from a difficult question by reducing its sense to a 
commonplace. With regard to appearances, to be sure, both understanding 
and reason can be used; but it must be asked whether they 
would still have any use if the object were not appearance (noumenon), 
and one takes it in this sense if one thinks of it as merely intelligible, i.e., 
as given to the understanding alone and not to the senses at all. The 
question is thus: whether beyond the empirical use of the understanding 
(even in the Newtonian representation of the cosmos) a transcendental 
one is also possible, pertaining to the noumenon as an 
object -which question we have answered negatively. 


A 2 58 If, therefore, we say: The senses represent objects to us as they appear, 
but the understanding, as they are, then the latter is not to be 
taken in a transcendental but in a merely empirical way, signifying, 
namely, how they must be represented as objects of experience, in the 

B 3 14 thoroughgoing connectiona of appearances, and not how they might be 
outside of the relation to possible experience and consequently to sense 
in general, thus as objects of pure understanding. For this will always 
remain unknown to us, so that it even remains unknown whether such 
a transcendental (extraordinary) cognition is possible at all, at least as 
one that stands under our customary categories. With us understanding 
and sensibility can determine an object only in combination. If 
we separate them, then we have intuitions without concepts, or concepts 
without intuitions, but in either case representations that we cannot 
relate to any determinate object. 

If after all this discussion anyone still has reservations about denying 
the categories a merely transcendental use, then he should test them in 
any synthetic assertion. For an analytic one takes the understanding no 
further, and since it is occupied only with that which is already thought 
in the concept, it leaves it undecided whether the concept even has any 


A259 relation to objects, or only signifies the unity of thinking in general 
(which entirely abstracts from the way in which an object might be 
given); it is enough for him to know what lies in its concept; what the 
concept might pertain to is indifferent to him. He should accordingly 

B 3 I 5 test it with some synthetic and allegedly transcendental principle, such 
as: "Everything that is, exists as substance, or a determination dependent 
on it," "Everything contingent exists as the effect of another thing, 
namely its cause," etc. Now I ask: Whence will he derive these synthetic 
propositions, since the concepts are not to hold of possible experience 
but rather of things in themselves (noumena)? Where is the third thing 
that is always requisite for a synthetic proposition in order to connect 
with each other concepts that have no logical (analytical) affinity? He

Phenomena and Noumena <B> 

will never prove his proposition, indeed, what is more, he will not even 
be able to justify the possibility of such a pure assertion, without taking 
account of the empirical use of the understanding, and thereby fully renouncing 
the pure and sense-free judgment. Thus the concept of pure, 
merely intelligible objects is entirely devoid of all principles of its application, 
since one cannot think upa any way in which they could be 
given, and the problematic thought, which leaves a place open for them, 
only serves, like an empty space, to limit the empirical principles, with-A260 
out containing and displaying any other objectb of cognition beyond 
the sphere of the latter.

On the amphiboly of the concepts 
of rejlectionb through the confusion of the 
empirical use of the understanding with 
the transcendental. 


Reflectionc (rejlexio) does not have to do with objects themselves, in 
order to acquire concepts directly from them, but is rather the state of 
mind in which we first prepare ourselves to find out the subjective conditions 
under which we can arrive at concepts.97 It is the consciousness 
of the relation d of given representations to our various sources of cognition, 
through which alone their relation among themselves can be 
correctly determined. The first question prior to all further treatment 
of our representation is this: In which cognitive faculty do they belong 
together? Is it the understanding or is it the senses before which they 
are connected or compared? Many a judgment is accepted out of habit, 
or connected through inclination: but since no reflection preceded or at 
A261 least critically succeeded it, it counts as one that has received its origin 
in the understanding. Not all judgments require an investigation, i.e., 
attention to the grounds of truth; for if they are immediately certain, 
B 3 17 e.g., between two points there can be only one straight line, then no 
further mark of truth can be given for them than what they themselves 
express. But all judgments, indeed all comparisons, require a reflection, 
i.e., a distinction of the cognitive power to which the given con

cepts belong.a The action through which I make the comparison of representations 
in general with the cognitive power in which they are situated, 
and through which I distinguish whether they are to be 
compared to one another as belonging to the pure understanding or to 
pure intuition, Icall transcendental reflection. The relation, however, 
in which the concepts in a state of mind can belong to each other are 
those of identityand difference, ofagreement and opposition, of the 
inner and the outer, and finally of the determinable and the determination 
(matter and form). The correct determination of this relation 
depends on the cognitive power in which they subjectively belong to 
each other, whether in sensibility or in understanding. For the difference 
in the latter makes a great difference in the way in which one 
ought to think of the former. 

Prior to all objective judgments we compare the concepts, with re-A262 
gard to identityb (of many representations under one concept) for the 
sake of universal judgments, or their difference, for the generation of 
particular ones, with regard to agreement, for affirmative judgments, B 3 18 
or opposition,' for negative ones, etc. On this ground it would seem 
that we ought to call these concepts concepts of comparison (conceptus 
comparationis). But since, if it is not the logical form but the content of 
concepts that is concerned, i.e., whether the things themselves are identical 
or different, in agreement or in opposition, etc., the things can 
have a twofold relation to our power of cognition, namely to sensibility 
and to understanding, yet it is this place in which they belong that concerns 
how they ought to belong to each other, then it is transcendental 
reflection, i.e., the relation of given representations to one or the other 
kind of cognition, that can alone determine their relation among themselves, 
and whether the things are identical or different, in agreement 
or in opposition, etc., cannot immediately be made out from the concepts 
themselves through mere comparison (comparatio), but rather only 
through the distinction of the kind of cognition to which they belong, 
by means of a transcendental reflection (reflexio). To be sure, one could

agreement in the phaenomenon?" (E CXLIII, pp. 44-5; 23:37)

therefore say that logical reflection is a mere comparison, for in its 
case there is complete abstraction from the cognitive power to which 
A263 the given representations belong, and they are thus to be treated the 

B 319 same as far as their seat in the mind is concerned; transcendental reflection, 
however, (which goes to the objects themselves) contains the 
ground of the possibility of the objective comparison of the representations 
to each other, and is therefore very different from the other, since 
the cognitive power to which the representations belong is not precisely 
the same. This transcendental reflection is a duty from which no one 
can escape ifhe would judge anything about things a priori. We will now 
take it in hand, and will draw from it not a little illumination of the determination 
of the proper business of the understanding.a 

1. Identity and difference.98 If an object is presented to us several 
times, but always with the same inner determinations (qualitas et quantitas), 
then it is always exactly the same if it counts as an object of pure 
understanding, not many but only oneb thing (numerica identitas)/ but if 
it is appearance, then the issue is not the comparison of concepts, but 
rather, however identical everything may be in regard to that, the difference 
of the places of these appearances at the same time is still an adequate 
ground for the numerical difference of the object (of the 
senses) itself. Thus, in the case of two drops of water one can comA264 
pletely abstract from all inner difference (of quality and quantity), and 
it is enough that they be intuited in different places at the same time in 
B 320 order for them to be held to be numerically different. Leibniz99 took 
the appearances for things in themselves, thus for intelligibilia, i.e., objects 
of the pure understanding (although on account of the confusion 
of their representations he labeled them with the name ofphenomena),d 
and there his principle of non-discernibility (principium identitatis indiscernibilium), 
could surely not be disputed,IOO but since they are objects 
of sensibility, and the understanding with regard to them is not of 
pure but of empirical use, multiplicity and numerical difference are already 
given by space itself as the condition of outer appearances. For a 
part of space, even though it might be completely similar and equal to 
anotller, is nevertheless outside of it, and is on that account a different 
part from that which is added to it in order to constitute a larger space; 
and this must therefore hold of everything that exists simultaneously in 

a 

Inserted in Kant's copy of the first edition: "These propositions obviously teach that 
space and time hold only of things, and among them also of ourselves, as appearances; 
for otherwise they would not yield entirely opposed propositions, like those we assert 
of things in themselves." (E CXLIV; p. 45; 23:37)

might otherwise be. 

2. Agreement and opposition. If reality is represented only through 
the pure understanding (realitas noumenon), then no opposition between 
realities can be thought, i.e., a relation such that when they are 
bound together in one subject they cancel out their consequences, as in A26S 
3 -3 = a.a,IOI Realitiesb in appearance (realitas phaenomenon), on the 
contrary, can certainly be in opposition with each other and, united in B 321 
the same subject, one can partly or wholly destroy the consequence of 
the other, like two moving forces in the same straight line that either 
push or pull a point in opposed directions, or also like an enjoyment 
that balances the scale against a pain. c 
3.d The inner and the outer. In an object of the pure understanding 
only that is internal that has no relatione (as far as the existence is concerned) 
to anything that is different from it. The inner determinations 
of a substantia phaenomenonf in space, on the contrary, are nothing but 
relations, and it is itself entirely a sum total of mere relations.g,b We 
know substance in space only through forces that are efficacious in it, 
whether in drawing others to it (attraction) or in preventing penetration 
of it (repulsion and impenetrability); we are not acquainted with other 
properties constituting the concept of the substance that appears in 
space and which we call matter. As object i of the pure understanding, 
on the contrary, every substance must have inner determinations and 
forces that pertain to its inner reality. Yet what can I think of as inner 
accidents except for those which my inner sense offers me? -namely A 266 
that which is either itself thinking or which is analogous to one. Thus 
because he represented them as noumena, taking away in thought every-B 322 
thing that might signify outer relation! thus even composition, Leibniz 
made out of all substances, even the constituents of matter, simple 
subjects gifted with powers of representation, in a word, monads.I02

flection, so inseparably are they bound up with every use of the understanding. 
The former signifies the determinable in general, the latter its 
determinationa (both in the transcendental sense,h since one abstracts 
from all differences in what is given and from the way in which that is 
determined). The logicians formerly called the universal the matter, but 
the specific difference the form. In every judgment one can call the given 
concepts logical matter (for judgment), their relation (by means of the 
copula) the form of the judgment. In every being its components (essentialia) 
are the matter; the way in which they are connected in a thing, the 
essential form. Also, in respect to things in general, unbounded reality is 
regarded as the matter of all possibility, but its limitation (negation) as 
A267 that form through which One thing is distinguished from another in accordance 
with transcendental concepts. The understanding, namely, de-
B 323 mands first that something be given (at least in the concept) in order to 
be able to determine it in a certain way. Hence in the concept of pure 
understanding matter precedes form, and on this account Leibniz first 
assumed things (monads) and an internal power of representation in 
them, in order subsequently to ground On that their outer relation and 
the community of their states (namely of the representations) on that. 
Hence space and time were possible, the former only through the relation 
of substances, the latter through the connection of their determinations 
as grounds and consequences.!03 And so would it in fact have to be 
if the pure understanding could be related to objects immediately, and if 
space and time were determinations of the things in themselves. But if it 
is only sensible intuitions in which we determine all objects merely as 
appearances, then the form of intuition (as a subjective constitution of 
sensibility) precedes all matter (the sensations), thus space and time precede 
all appearances and all data of appearances, and instead first make 
the latter possible. The intellectualist philosopher could not bear it that 
form should precede the things and determine their possibility; a quite 
appropriate criticism, if he assumed that we intuit things as they are 

A268 (though with confused representation). But since sensible intuition is an 

B 324 entirely peculiar subjective condition, which grounds all perception a 
priori, and the form of which is original, thus the form is given for itself 
alone, and so far is it from being the case that the matter (or the things 
themselves, which appear) ought to be the ground (as one would have to 
judge according to mere concepts), that rather their possibility presupposes 
a formal intuition (of space and time) as given. 

a Inserted in Kant's copy of the first edition: "The thoroughgoing determination as principle 
[Princip] is grounded on the unity of consciousness: existence determined in space 
and time. Hence in noumena the highest reality contains the matter and the form contains 
the perfection. Theformale is the best." (E CXLIX, p. 45; 23:37)

On the amphiboly of concepts of reflection 
Remark 
to the amphiboly of the concepts of reflection. 
Allow me to call the position that we assign to a concept either in sensibility 
or in pure understanding its transcendental place. In the same 
way, the estimation of this position that pertains to every concept in accordance 
with the difference in its use, and guidance for determining 
this place for all concepts in accordance with rules, would be the transcendental 
topic, a doctrine that would thoroughly protect against 
false pretenses of the pure understanding and illusions arising therefrom 
by always distinguishing to which cognitive power the concepts 
properly belong. One can call every concept, every title under which 
many cognitions belong, a logical place. On this is grounded the logical 
topics of Aristotle, which schoolteachers and orators could use in 
order to hunt up certain titles of thinking to find that which best fits A269 
their current matter and rationalize or garrulously chatter about it with 
an appearance of thoroughness. 104 
B 325 
The transcendental topic, on the contrary, contains nothing more 
than the four titles for all comparison and distinction introduced above, 
which are distinguished from categories by the fact that what is exhibited 
through them is not the object in accordance with what constitutes 
its concept (magnitude, reality), but rather only the comparison of representations, 
in all their manifoldness, which precedes the concepts of 
things. This comparison, however, first requires a reflection, i.e., a determination 
of the place where the representations of the things that are 
compared belong, thus of whether they are thought by the pure understanding 
or given in appearance by sensibility. 
The concepts can be compared logically without worrying about 
where their objectsa belong, whether as noumenab to the understanding 
or as phenomena" to sensibility. But if we would get to the objects with 
these concepts, then transcendental reflection about which cognitive 
power they are objects for, whether for the pure understanding or for 
sensibility, is necessary first of all. Without this reflection I can make 

only a very insecure use of these concepts, and there arise allegedly syn-. 
thetic principles, which critical reason cannot acknowledge and that are A2 70/ B 326 
grounded solely on a transcendental amphiboly, i.e., a confusion of the 
pure object of the understandingd with the appearance. 

Lacking such a transcendental topic, and thus deceived by the amphiboly 
of the concepts of reflection, the famous Leibniz constructed

an intellectual system of the world, or rather believed himself able to 
cognize the inner constitution of things by comparing all objects only 
with the understanding and the abstract formal concepts of its thinking. 
Our table of the concepts of reflection gives us the unexpected advantage 
of laying before our eyes that which is distinctive in his theory in 
all its parts and the leading ground of this peculiar way of thinking, 
which rests on nothing but a misunderstanding. He compared all things 
with each other solely through concepts, and found, naturally, no other 
differences than those through which the understanding distinguishes 
its pure concepts from each other. The conditions of sensible intuition, 
which bring with them their own distinctions, he did not regard as original; 
for sensibility was only a confused kind of representation for him, 
and not a special source of representations; for him appearance was the 
representation of the thing in itself, although distinguished from cognition 
through the understanding in its logical form, since with its customary 
lack of analysis the former draws a certain mixture of subsidiary 
representations into the concept of the thing, from which the understanding 
knows how to abstract. In a word, Leibniz intellectualized 
the appearances, just as Locke totally sensitivized the concepts of understanding 
in accordance with his system of noogony (if! am permitted 
this expression), i.e., interpreted them as nothing but empirical or 
abstracted concepts of reflection. 105 Instead of seeking two entirely different 
sources of representation in the understanding and the sensibility, 
which could judge about things with objective validity only in 
conjunction,a each of these great men holds on only to one of them, 
which in his opinion is immediately related to things in themselves, 
while the other does nothing but confuse or order the representations 
of the first. 

Leibniz accordingly compared the objects of the senses with each 
other as things in general, merely in the understanding, b first, so far as 
they are to be judged by the understanding as identical or different. 
Since he therefore had before his eyes solely their concepts, and not 
their position in the intuition in which alone the objects can be given, 
and left entirely out of consideration the transcendental place of these 
concepts (whether the objectC is to be counted among appearances or 
among things in themselves), it could not have turned out otherwise but 
that he extended his principle of indiscernibles,d which holds merely of 
concepts of things in general, to the objects of the senses (mundus 
phaenomenon),e and thereby believed himself to have made no little ad-

vance in the cognition of nature. Of course, if! know a drop of water as 
a thing in itself according to all of its inner determinations, I cannot let 
anyrone drop count as different from another if the entire concept of 
the former is identical with that of the latter. But if it is an appearance 
in space, then it has its place not merely in the understanding (under 
concepts), but also in the sensible outer intuition (in space), and since 
the physical places are entirely indifferent with regard to the inner determinations 
of the things, a place = b can just as readily accept a thing 
that is fully similar and equal to another in a place = a as it could if the 
former were ever so internally different from the latter. Without further 
conditions, the difference in place already makes the multiplicity 
and distinction of objects as appearances not only possible in itself but 
also necessary. Thus that putative law is no law of nature. It is simply an 
analytical rule or comparison of things through mere concepts. 


Second, the principle that realities (as mere affirmations) never logically 
oppose each other is an entirely true proposition about the rela-A273 
tions of concepts, but signifies nothing at all either in regard to nature B329 
nor overall in regard to anything in itself (of this we have no concept). 
For real opposition always obtains where A B = 0, i.e., where one re


-

ality, if combined in one subject with another, cancels out the effect of 
the latter, which is unceasingly placed before our eyes by all hindrances 
and countereffects in nature, which, since they rest on forces, must be 
called realitates phaenomena.a General mechanics can even provide the 
empirical condition of this opposition in aD a priori rule by looking to 
the opposition of directions -a condition about which the transcendental 
concept of reality knows nothing at all.106 Although Herr von 
Leibniz did not exactly announce this proposition with the pomp of a 
new principle, he nevertheless used it for new assertions, and his successors 
expressly incorporated it into their Leibnizian-Wolffian doctrine. 
According to this principle, e.g., all ills are nothing but consequences 
of the limits of created beings, i.e., negations, since these are 
the only opposing things in reality (this is really so in the concept of a 
thing in general, but not in things as appearances).107 Similarly, its adherents 
find it not merely possible but also natural to unite all reality in B 330 
one being without any worry about opposition, since they do not rec-A 274 
ognize any opposition except that of contradiction (through which the 
concept of a thing would itself be canceled out), lOS and do not recognize 
the opposition of reciprocal destruction, where one real ground cancels 
out the effect of another, the conditions for the representation of which 
we find only in sensibility. 

Third, the Leibnizian monadology has no ground at all other than 
the fact that this philosopher represented the distinction of the inner 

n phenomenal realities 


373

and outer merely in relation to the understanding. Substances in general 
must have something inner, which is therefore free of all outer relations, 
consequently also of composition. The simple is therefore the 
foundation of the inner in things in themselves. But that which is inner 
in their state cannot consist in place, shape, contact, or motion (which 
determinations are all outer relations), and we can therefore attribute to 
the substances no other inner state than that through which we internally 
determine our sense itself, namely the state of representations. 
This completes the monads, which are to constitute the fundamental 
matter of the entire universe, the active power of which, however, consists 
merely in representations, through which they are properly efficacious 
merely within themselves. 

For this very reason, however, his principlea of the possible community 
of substances among themselves also had to be predetermined 
harmony and could not be a physical influence.109 For since everything 
is only internal, i.e., occupied with its own representations, the state of 
the representations of one substance could not stand in any efficacious 
connection at all with that of another, but some third cause influencing 
all of them had to make their states correspond to one another, not, to 
be sure, through occasional assistance specially brought about in each 
case (systema assistentiae),b but rather through the unity of the idea of one 
cause valid for all, from which, in accordance with general laws, they 
must all together acquire their existence and persistence, thus also their 
reciprocal correspondence with each other. 

Fourth, Leibniz's famous doctrine of space and time, in which he 
intellectualized these forms of sensibility, arose solely from this very 
same deception of transcendental reflection. If I would represent outer 
relations of things through the mere understanding, this can be done 
only by means of a concept of their reciprocal effect, and should I connect 
one state of the one and the same thing with another state, then 
this can only be done in the order of grounds and consequences. Thus 
Leibniz thought of space as a certain order in the community of substances, 
and thought of time as the dynamic sequence of their states.IIO 
The uniqueness and independence from things, however, which both of 
these seem to have in themselves, he ascribed to the confusion of these 
concepts, which made that which is a mere form of dynamical relations 
be taken for an intuition subsisting by itself and preceding the things 
themselves. Thus space and time became the intelligible form of the 
connection of the things (substances and their states) in themselves. 
The things, however, were intelligible substances (substantiae noumena). 
Nevertheless he wanted to make these concepts valid for appearances, 

" Principium 
b "System of assistance," i.e., the occasionalism of Nicolas Malebranche. 


374 



On the amphiboly of concepts of reflection 

since he conceded to sensibility no kind of intuition of its own, but 
rather sought everything in the understanding, even the empirical representation 
of objects, and left nothing for the senses but the contemptible 
occupation of confusing and upsetting the representations of 
the former. 

But even if we could say anything synthetically about things in 
themselves through the pure understanding (which is nevertheless impossible), 
this still could not be related to appearances at all, which do 
not represent things in themselves. In this latter case, therefore, I will 
always have to compare my concepts in transcendental reflection only 
under the conditions of sensibility, and thus space and time will not be 
determinations of things in themselves, but of appearances; what the 
things may be in themselves I do not know, and also do not need to 
know, since a thing can never come before me except in appearance. 

I proceed in the same way with the other concepts of reflection. 
Matter is substantia phaenomenon. a What pertains to it internally I seek 
in all parts of space that it occupies and in all effects that it carries out, 
and which can certainly always be only appearances of outer sense. I 
therefore have nothing absolutely but only comparatively internal, 
which itself in turn consists of outer relations. Yet the absolutely internal 
in matter, according to pure understanding, is a mere fancy, for it is 
nowhere an object for the pure understanding; the transcendental object,
b however, which might be the ground of this appearance that we 
call matter, is a mere something, about which we would not understand 
what it is even if someone could tell us. For we cannot understand anything 
except that which has something corresponding to our words in 
intuition. If the complaints "That we have no insight into the inner 
in things"!II are to mean that we do not understand through pure reason 
what the things that appear to us might be in themselves, then they 
are entirely improper and irrational; for they would have us be able to 
cognize things, thus intuit them, even without senses, consequently 
they would have it that we have a faculty of cognition entirely distinct 
from the human not merely in degree but even in intuition and kind, 
and thus that we ought to be not humans but beings that we cannot 
even say are possible, let alone how they are constituted. Observation 
and analysis of the appearances penetrate into what is inner in nature, 
and one cannot know how far this will go in time. Those transcendental 
questions, however, that go beyond nature, we will never be able to 
answer, even if all of nature is revealed to us, sinceC it is never given to

us to observe our own mind with any other intuition that that of our 
inner sense. For in that lies the mystery of the origin of our sensibility. 
Its relationa to an object, b and what might be the transcendental ground 
of this unity, undoubtedly lie too deeply hidden for us, who know even 
ourselves only through inner sense, thus as appearance, to be able to use 
such an unsuitable tool of investigation to find out anything except always 
more appearances, even though we would gladly investigate their 
non-sensible cause. 

What makes this critique of the inferences from the mere actions of 
reflection useful above all is that it clearly establishes the nullity of all inferences 
about objects that one simply compares with each other in the 
understanding, and at the same time confirms what we have chiefly emphasized: 
that although appearances cannot be comprehended among 
the objectsC of pure understanding as things in themselves, they are nevertheless 
the only things by means of which our cognition can have objective 
reality, namely, where intuition corresponds to the concepts. 

If we reflect merely logically, then we simply compare our concepts 
with each other in the understanding, seeing whether two of them contain 
the very same thing, whether they contradict each other or not, 
whether something is contained in the concept internally or is added to 
it, and which of them should count as given and which as a manner of 
thinking of that which is given. But if I apply these concepts to an object 
in general (in the transcendental sense),d without further determining 
whether this is an object of sensible or intellectual intuition, then 
limitations (which do not flow from this concept) immediately show up, 
which pervert all empirical use of them, and by that very means prove 
that the representation of an object as a thing in general is not merely 
insufficient but rather, without sensible determinations of it and independent 
of an empirical condition, contradictory in itself, thus that 
one must either abstract from any object (in logic), or else, if one assumes 
an object, then one must think it under conditions of sensible intuition; 
thus the intelligible would require an entirely special intuition, 
which we do not have, and in the absence of this would be nothing for 
us, though on the contrary appearances also cannot be objects in themselves. 
For, if I think of mere things in general, then the difference in

posit one and the same thing in different relations. Further, through the 
addition of one mere affirmation (reality) to another the positive is increased, 
and nothing is taken away from it or canceled out; hence the 
real in things in general cannot contradict each other, etc. 

* * * 

As we have shown, through a certain misinterpretation the concepts 
of reflection have had such an influence on the use of the understanding 
that they have even been able to seduce one of the most acute of all 
philosophers into a supposed system of intellectual cognition, which 
undertakes to determine its object without supplementation by the 
senses. For just this reason the exposition of the deceptive cause of the 
amphiboly of these concepts, as the occasion of false principles, is of 
great utility in reliably determining and securing the boundaries of the 
understanding. 

One must say, to be sure, that whatever pertains to or contradicts a B 337 
concept in general also pertains to or contradicts everything particular A28I 
that is contained under that concept (dictum de Omni et Nullo);a,"i2 but it 
would be absurd to alter this logical principle so that it would read: 
"\Vhatever is not contained in a general concept is also not contained 
in the particular ones that stand under it"; for the latter are particular 
concepts precisely because they contain more than is thought in the 
general concept. Yet Leibniz's entire intellectual system is really built 
on the latter principle: it therefore falls together with it, along with all 
of the ambiguity in the use of the understanding that arises from it. 

The principle of indiscernibles is really based on the presupposition 
that if a certain distinction is not to be found in the concept of a thing 
in general, then it is also not to be found in the things themselves; consequently 
all things are completely identical (numero eadem)b that are 
not already distinguished from each other in their concepts (as to quality 
or quantity). But since in the mere concept of anything abstraction 
is made from many necessary conditions of an intuition, it is with peculiar 
haste that that from which abstraction has been made is taken as 
something that is not to be encountered at all, and nothing conceded to B 338 
the thing except what is contained in its concept. 

The concept of a cubic foot of space, wherever and however often I A282 
think it, is in itself always completely the same. Yet two cubic feet are 
nevertheless distinguished in space merely through their locations (numero

of this concept is given, which do not belong to the concept but to the 
entire sensibility. In the same way, there is no contradiction at all in the 
concept of a thing if nothing negative is connected with something affirmative, 
and merely affirmative concepts cannot, in combination, effect 
any cancellation. Yet in the sensible intuition in which reality (e.g., 
motion) is given, there are conditions (opposed directions), from which 
one had abstracted in the concept of motion in general, that make possible 
a conflict, which is certainly not a logical one, that produces a zero 
= 0 out of that which is entirely positive; and one could not say that all 
reality is in agreement just because no conflicta is to be found among its 
concepts.* According to mere concepts the inner is the substratum of all 
relation or outer determinations. If, therefore, I abstract from all conditions 
of intuition, and restrict myself solely to the concept of a thing 
in general, then I can abstract from every outer relation, and yet there 
must remain a concept of it, that signifies no relation but merely inner 
determinations. Now it seems as if it follows from this that in every 
thing (substance) there is something that is absolutely internal and precedes 
all outer determinations, first making them possible, thus that this 
substratum is something that contains no more outer relations in itself, 
consequently that it is simple (for corporeal things are still always only 
relations, at least of the parts outside one another); and since we are not 
acquainted with any absolutely inner determinations except through 
our inner sense, this substratum would be not only simple, but also (according 
to the analogy with our inner sense) determined through representations, 
i.e., all things would really be monads, or simple beings 
endowed with representations. "3And this would all be correct, were it 
not that something more than the concept of a thing in general belongs 
to the conditions under which alone objects of outer intuition can be 
given to us, and from which the pure concept abstracts. For these show 
that a persistent appearance in space (impenetrable extension) contains 
mere relations and nothing absolutely internal, and nevertheless can be 
the primary substratum of all outer perception. Through mere concepts, 
of course, I cannot think of something external without anything 

* If one wanted to make use of the usual escape here, that at least realitates 
noumena cannot act in opposition to each other, one would still have to introduce 
an example of such pure and non-sensible reality in order to understand 
whether such a reality represents something or nothing at all. But no example 
can be derived from anywhere except experience, which never offers more 
thanphaenomena, and thus this proposition signifies nothing more than that a 
concept that contains only affirmations does not contain anything negative: a 
proposition that we have never doubted.

inner, for the very reason that relational concepts absolutely presuppose 
given things and are not possible without these. But since something is 
contained in the intuition that does not lie at all in the mere concept of 
a thing in general, and this yields the substratum that cannot be cognized 
through mere concepts, namely a space that, along with everything 
that it contains, consists of purely formal or also real relations, I 
cannot say that since without something absolutely inner no thing can 
be represented through mere concepts, there is also nothing outer 
that does not have something absolutely internal as its ground in the 
things themselves that are contained under these concepts and in their 
intuition. For if we have abstracted from all conditions of intuition, 
then of course there remains nothing in the mere concept except the B 341 
inner in general, and its relation in that, through which alone the outer 
is possible. But this necessity, which is grounded only on abstraction, 
does not obtain in the case of things insofar as they are given in intu-A28S 
ition with determinations that express mere relations without having 
anything inner at their ground, since these are not things in themselves 
but simply appearances. And whatever we can cognize only in matter is 
pure relations (that which we call their inner determinations is only 
comparatively internal); but there are among these some self-sufficient 
and persistent ones, through which a determinate object is given to us. 
The fact that if I abstract from these relations I have nothing further to 
think at all does not cancel out the concept of a thing as appearance, nor 
the concept of an object in abstracto, but does cancel all possibility of 
such an object determinable in accordance with mere concepts, i.e., a 
concept of a noumenon.a It is certainly startling to hear that a thing 
should consist entirely of relations, but such a thing is also mere appearance, 
and cannot be thought at all through pure categories; it itself 
consists in the mere relation of something in general to the senses. In 
the same way, if one begins with mere concepts one cannot very well 
think of the relations of things in abstracto except by thinking that one B 342 
is the cause of the determinations in the other; for that is our concept 
of the understanding of relations itself. Yet since in this case we abstract 
from all intuition, an entire way in which the manifold can determine 
its place, namely the form of sensibility (space) disappears, which yet A286 
precedes all empirical causality. 

If by merely intelligible objects we understand those things that are 
thoughtb through pure categories, without any schema of sensibility, 
then things of this sort are impossible. For the condition of the objective 
use of all our concepts of understanding is merely the manner of 
our sensible intuition, through which objects are given to us, and, if we

abstract from the latter, then the former have no relationa at all to any 
sort of object.b Indeed, even if one would assume another sort of intuition 
than this our sensible one, our functions for thinking would still 
be without any significance in regard to it. If we understand thereby 
only objects of a non-sensible intuition, of which our categories are certainly 
not valid, and of which we can therefore never have any cognition 
at all (neither intuition nor concept), then noumena in this merely 
negative sense must of course be allowed: for they would then not say 
anything but that our manner of intuition does not pertain to all things, 
but only to objects of our senses, consequently that their objective validity 
is bounded, and room thus remains for some other sort of intuition 
and therefore also for things as its objects.c But in that case the 
concept of a noumenon is problematic, i.e., the representation of a thing 
of which we can say neither that it is possible nor that it is impossible, 
since we are acquainted with no sort of intuition other than our own 
sensible one and no other sort of concepts than the categories, neither 
of which, however, is suited to an extrasensible object. Hence we cannot 
thereby positively expand the field of the objects of our thinking beyond 
the conditions of our sensibility, and assume beyond appearances 
objects of pure thinking, i.e., noumena, since those do not have any 
positive significance that can be given. For one must concede that the 
categories alone are not sufficient for the cognition of things in themselves, 
and without the data of sensibility they would be merely subjective 
forms of the unity of the understanding, but without any object. 
Thinking in itself, to be sure, is not a product of the senses, and to this 
extent is also not limited by them, but it is not on that account immediately 
of any independent and pure use, without assistance from sensibility, 
for it is in that case without an object.d And one cannot call the 
noumenon e such an object!for this signifies precisely the problematic 
concept of an object for an entirely different intuition and an entirely 

B 344 

different understanding than our own, which is thus a problem itself. 
The concept of the noumenong is therefore not the concept of an object,
h but rather the problem, unavoidably connected with the limitation 
of our sensibility, of whether there may not be objects entirely exempt 
Az88 from the intuition of our sensibility, a question that can only be given

On the amphiboly of concepts of reflection 

the indeterminate answer that since sensible intuition does not pertain 
to all things without distinction room remains for more and other objects; 
they cannot therefore be absolutely denied, but in the absence of 
a determinate concept (for which no category is serviceable) they also 
cannot be asserted as objects for our understanding. 

The understanding accordingly bounds sensibility without thereby 
expanding its own field, and in warning sensibility not to presume to 
reach for things in themselves but solely for appearances it thinks of an 
object in itself, but only as a transcendental object,a which is the caus􀝡 
of appearance (thus not itself appearance), and that cannot be thought 
of either as magnitude or as reality or as substance, etc. (since these concepts 
always require sensible forms in which they determine an object); 
it therefore remains completely unknown whether such an object is to 
be encountered within or without us, whether it would be canceled out 
along with sensibility or whether it would remain even if we took sensibility 
away. If we want to call this objectb a noumenonC because the B 345 
representation of it is nothing sensible, we are free to do so. But since 
we caimot apply any of our concepts of the understanding to it, this representation 
still remains empty for us, and serves for nothing but to designate 
the boundaries of our sensible cognition and leave open a space A289 
that we can fill up neither through possible experience nor through the 
pure understanding. 

The critique of this pure understanding thus does not allow us to create 
a new field of objects beyond those that can come before it as appearances, 
and 
Irto indulge in intelligible worlds, or even in the concept 
of them. The mistake that most obviously leads to this, and can certainly 
be excused though not justified, lies in this: that the use of the understanding, 
contrary to its vocation, d is made transcendental, and the 
objects, i.e., possible intuitions, are made to conform themselves to 
concepts, but concepts are not made to conform themselves to possible 
intuitions (on which alone rests their objective validity). The cause of 
this, however, is in turn that apperception and, with it, thinking precede 
all possible determination of the arrangement of representations. We 
therefore think something in general, and on the one side determine it 
sensibly, only we also distinguish the object represented in general and B 346 
in abstracto from this way of intuiting it; thus there remains to us a way 
of determining it merely through thinking that is, to be sure, a merely 
logical form without content, but that nevertheless seems to us to be a

way in which the objecta exists in itself (noumenon), without regard to

Before we leave the Transcendental Analytic behind, we must add 
something that, although not in itself especially indispensable, nevertheless 
may seem requisite for the completeness of the system. The 
highest concept with which one is accustomed to begin a transcendental 
philosophy is usually the division between the possible and the impossible."
4 But since every division presupposes a concept that is to be 
divided, a still higher one must be given, and this is the concept of an 
object in general (taken problematically, leaving undecided whether it is 
something or nothing). Since the categories are the only concepts that 
relate to objects in general, the distinction of whether an object is something 
or nothing must proceed in accordance with the order and guidance 
of the categories.b,lls 

B347 I) To the concepts of all, many, and one there is opposed the concept 
of that which cancels everything out, i.e., none, and thus the 
object of a concept to which no intuition that can be given corresponds 
is == nothing, ie., a concept without an object, like the 
noumena, which cannot be counted among the possibilities although 
they must not on that ground be asserted to be impossible 
(ens rationis),c or like something such as certain new fundamental 

A291 forces, which one thinks, without contradiction, to be sure, but 
also without any example from experience even being thought, and 
which must therefore not be counted among the possibilities.

the possibilities because it is a mere invention (although not self-contradictory), 
whereas the latter is opposed to possibility because even its 
concept cancels itself out. Both, however, are empty concepts. The nihil B 349 
privativum (NO.r2) and the ens imaginarium (No.r3), on the contrary, are 
empty data for concepts. If light were not given to the senses, then one 
would also not be able to represent darkness, and if extended beings

Introductiona

Transcendental illusion. 

Above we have called dialectic in general a logic of illusion.b That does 
not mean that it is a doctrine of probability;c for that is truth, but cognized 
through insufficient grounds, so that the cognition of it is defective, 
but not therefore deceptive, and so it need not be separated from 
the analytical part of logic. 2 Still less may we take appearanced and il-
B 350 lusion for one and the same. For truth and illusion are not in the object, 
insofar as it is intuited, but in the judgment about it insofar as it is 
thought. Thus it is correctly said that the senses do not err; yet not because 
they always judge correctly, but because they do not judge at all. 
Hence truth, as much as error, and thus also illusion as leading to the 
latter, are to be found only in judgments, i.e., only in the relatione of the 
object to our understanding. In a cognition that thoroughly agrees with 
A294 the laws of the understanding there is also no error. In a representation 
of sense (because it contains no judgment at all) there is no error. No 
force of nature can of itself depart from its own laws. Hence neither the 
understanding by itself (without the influence of another cause), nor the 
senses by themselves, can err; the first cannot, because while it acts 
merely according to its own laws, its effect (the judgment) must necessarily 
agree with these laws.3 But the formal aspect of all truth consists 
in agreement with the laws of the understanding. In the senses there is 
no judgment at all, neither a true nor a false one. Now because we have

"We have previously proved that we can think only through categories and the concepts 
derived from them, but that our cognition (a p"iori) with them can reach no farther than

Introduction 

no other sources of cognition besides these two, it follows that error is 
effected only through the unnoticed influence of sensibility on understanding, 
through which it happens that the subjective grounds a of the 
judgment join with the objective ones, and make the latter deviate from B 351 
their destination*,b just as a moved body would of itself always stay in a 
straight line in the same direction, but starts off on a curved line if at 
the same time another force influences it in another direction. In order 
to distinguish the proper action of the understanding from the force A295 
that meddles in, it will thus be necessary to regard the erroneous judgment 
of the understanding as a diagonal between two forces that determine 
the judgment in two different directions, enclosing an angle, so to 
speak, and to resolve the composite effect into the simple effects of the 
understanding and of sensibility; in pure judgments a priori this must 
happen through transcendental reflection, through which (as already 
shown) every representation is assigned its place in the faculty of cognition 
proper to it, and hence also the influence of the latter is distinguished 
from it. 

Our concern here is not to treat of empirical (e.g. optical) illusion, 
which occurs in the empirical use of otherwise correct rules of the un-B 352 
derstanding, and through which the faculty of judgment is misled 
through the influence of the imagination; rather, we have to do only with 
transcendental illusion, which influences principles whose use is not 
ever meant for experience, since in that case we would at least have a 
touchstone for their correctness, but which instead, contrary to all the 
warnings of criticism, carries us away beyond the empirical use of the 
categories, and holds out to us the semblance of extending the pure understanding. 
We will call the principles whose application stays wholly 
and completely within the limits of possible experience immanent, but A296 
those that would fly beyond these boundaries transcendent principles. 
But by the latter I do not understand the transcendental use or misuse 
of categories, which is a mere mistake of the faculty of judgment when 
it is not properly checked by criticism, and thus does not attend enough 
to the boundaries of the territory in which alone the pure understanding 
is allowed its play; rather, I mean principles that actually incite us to tear 
down all those boundary posts and to lay claim to a wholly new territory 

* Sensibility, subordinated to understanding, as the object' to which the latter A294/Br35I 
applies its function, is the source of real cognitions. But this same sensibility, 
insofar as it influences the action of the understanding and determines it to 
judgments, is the ground of error.

that recognizes no demarcations anywhere. Hence transcendental and 
transcendent are not the same. The principles of pure understanding 
we presented above should be only of empirical and not of transcenden-

B 353 tal use, i.e., of a use that reaches out beyond the boundaries of experience. 
But a principle that takes away these limits, which indeed bids us 
to overstep them, is called transcendent. If our critique can succeed in 
discovering the illusion in these supposed principles, then those principles 
that are of merely empirical use can be called, in opposition to them, 
immanent principles of pure understanding. 

Logical illusion, which consists in the mere imitation of the form of 

reason (the illusion of fallacious inferences) arises solely from a failure 

of attentiveness to the logical rule. Hence as soon as this attentiveness 

A297 is focused on the case before us, logical illusion entirely disappears. 
Transcendental illusion, on the other hand, does not cease even though 
it is uncovered and its nullity is clearly seen into by transcendental criticism 
(e.g. the illusion in the proposition: "The world must have a beginning 
in time"). The cause of this is that in our reason (considered 
subjectively as a human faculty of cognition) there lie fundamental rules 
and maxims for its use, which look entirely like objective principles, and 
through them it comes about that the subjective necessity of a certain 
connection of our concepts on behalf of the understanding is taken for 
an objective necessity, the determination of things in themselves. [This 

B 3 
54 is] an illusion that cannot be avoided at all, just as little as we can avoid 
it that the sea appears higher in the middle than at the shores, since we 
see the former through higher rays of light than the latter, or even better, 
just as little as the astronomer can prevent the rising moon from appearing 
larger to him, even when he is not deceived by this illusion.4 
The transcendental dialectic will therefore content itself with uncovering 
the illusion in transcendental judgments, while at the same time 
protecting us from being deceived by it; but it can never bring it about 

A298 that transcendental illusion (like logical illusion) should even disappear 
and cease to be an illusion. For what we have to do with here is a natural 
and unavoidable illusiona which itself rests on subjective principles 
and passes them off as objective, whereas logical dialectic in its 
dissolution of fallacious inferences has to do only with an error in following 
principles or with an artificial illusion that imitates them.s 
Hence there is a natural and unavoidable dialectic of pure reason, not 
one in which a bungler might be entangled through lack of acquaintance, 
or one that some sophist has artfully invented in order to confuse 
rational people, but one that irremediably attaches to human reason, so 
that even after we have exposed the mirageb it will still not cease to lead

On pure reason as the seat of transcendental illusion 

A. 

On reason in general. 

All our cognition starts from the senses, goes from there to the understanding, 
and ends with reason, beyond which there is nothing higher 
to be found in us to work on the matter of intuition and bring it under 
the highest unity of thinking. Since I am now to give a definitiona of A299 
this supreme faculty of cognition, I find myself in some embarrassment. 
As in the case of the understanding, there is in the case of reason a 
merely formal, i.e., logical use, where reason abstracts from all content 
of cognition, but there is also a real use, since reason itself contains the 
origin of certain concepts and principles, which it derives neither from 
the senses nor from the understanding. The first faculty has obviously 
long since been defined by the logicians as that of drawing inferences 
mediately (as distinct from immediate inferences, consequentis immediatis); 
but from this we get no insight into the second faculty, which itself 
generates concepts.6 Now since a division of reason into a logical 
and a transcendental faculty occurs here, a higher concept of this source B 356 
of cognition must be sought that comprehends both concepts under itself, 
while from the analogy with concepts of the understanding, we can 
expect both that the logical concept will put in our hands the key to the 
transcendental one and that the table of functions of the former will 
give us the family tree of the concepts of reason. 

In the first part of our transcendental logic we defined the understanding 
as the faculty of rules; here we will distinguish reason from understanding 
by calling reason the faculty of principles.b 

The term "a principle" is ambiguous, and commonly signifies only a A 300 
cognition that can be used as a principle even if in itself and as to its own 
origin it is not a principle.c Every universal proposition, even if it is 

a Erkliirung 

b Principien; in section II of this introduction, "principle" always translates Princip unless 
otherwise noted. In addition to the German term Grundsatz, Kant employs not only 
the Latin derivative Princip, but also occasionally the even more Latinate Principium, 

whose occurrence will be noted; the plural of both terms, however, is Principien, which 
will therefore be translated as "principles" with no note. Outside the present section, 
"principle" (without a note) always translates Grundsatz, and the Latin terms are always 
noted.

taken from experience (by induction) can serve as the major premise in 
a syllogism;a but it is not therefore itself a principle. b The mathematical 
axioms (e.g., that there can be only one straight line between any 
two points) are even universal cognitions a priori, and thus they are correctly 
called principles relative to the cases that can be subsumed under 
them. But I cannot therefore say that in general and in itself I cognize 
B 357 this proposition about straight lines from principles, but only that I 
cognize it in pure intuition. 
I would therefore call a "cognition from principles" that cognition in 
which I cognize the particular in the universal through concepts. Thus 
every syllogism is a form of derivation of a cognition from a principle. 
For the major premise always gives a concept such that everything subsumed 
under its condition can be cognized from it according to a principle. 
Now since every universal cognition can serve as the major 
premise in a syllogism, and since the understanding yields such universal 
propositions a priori, these propositions can, in respect of their possible 
use, be called principles. 

A301 But if we consider these principlesc of pure understanding in themselves 
as to their origin, then they are anything but cognitions from 
concepts. For they would not even be possible a priori if we did not 
bring in pure intuition (in mathematics) or the conditions of a possible 
experience in general. That everything that happens has a cause cannot 
at all be inferred from the concept of what happens in general; rather, 
it is this principled that shows how one can first get a determinate experiential 
concept of what happens. 

Thus the understanding cannot yield synthetic cognitions from con


B 358 cepts at all, and it is properly these that I call principles absolutely; nevertheless, 
all universal propositions in general can be called principles 
comparatively. 

It is an ancient wish -who knows how long it will take until perhaps 
it is fulfilled -that in place of the endless manifold of civil laws, their 
principles may be sought out; for in this alone can consist the secret, as 
one says, of simplifying legislation. But here the laws are only limitations 
of our freedom to conditions under which it agrees thoroughly 
with itself; hence they apply to something that is wholly our own work, 
and of which we can be the cause through that concept. But that ob-
A302 jects in themselves, as well as the nature of things, should stand under 
principles and be determined according to mere concepts is something

be so translated below.

that, if not impossible, is at least very paradoxicala in what it demands. 
But however that may be (for the investigation of this still lies before 
us), this much at least is clear; cognition from principles (in themselves) 
is something entirely different from mere cognition of the understanding, 
which can of course precede other cognitions in the form of a principle, 
but in itself (insofar at it is synthetic) still neither rests on mere 
thought nor contains in itself a universal according to concepts. 

If the understanding may be a faculty of unity of appearances by B 359 
means of rules, then reason is the faculty of the unity of the rules of understanding 
under principles.7 Thus itb never applies directly to experience 
or to any object, but instead applies to the understanding, in 
order to give unity a priori through concepts to the understanding's 
manifold cognitions, which may be called "the unity of reason," and is 
of an altogether different kind than any unity that can be achieved by 
the understanding. 

This is the universal concept of the faculty of reason, as far as that 
concept can be made comprehensible wholly in the absence of examples 
(such as those that are to be given only in what follows). 


B. A303 
On the logical use of reason. 
We draw a distinction between what is cognized immediately and what 
is only inferred. That there are three angles in a figure enclosed by 
three straight lines is immediately cognized, but that these angles together 
equal two right angles is only inferred. Because we constantly 
need inferences and so in the end become wholly accustomed to them, 
it happens at last that we no longer even take notice of this distinction, 
and often, as in so-called deceptions of sense, we take as immediate 
what we have only inferred. In every inference there is a proposition B 360 
that serves as a ground, and' another, namely the conclusion, that is 
drawn from the former, andd finally the inference (consequence) according 
to which the truth of the conclusion is connected unfailingly 
with the truth of the first proposition. If the inferred judgment already 
lies in the first one, so that it can be derived from it without the mediation 
of a third representation, then this is called an "immediate inference" 
(consequentia immediata); I would rather call it an inference of the 
understanding.8 But if, in addition to the cognition that serves as a 
ground, yet another judgment is necessary to effect the conclusion,

then the inference is called a "syllogism."a In the proposition All hu



A304 
mans are mortal there lie already the propositions "Some humans are 
mortal," "Someb mortal beings are human beings," "NothingC immortal 
is a human being," and these propositions are thus immediate conclusions 
from the first one. On the other hand, the proposition "All 
scholars are mortal" does not lie in the underlying judgment (for the 
concept "scholar" does not occur in it at all), and can be concluded 
from it only by means of an intermediate judgment. 

In every syllogism I think first a rule (the major) through the understanding. 
Second, I subsume a cognition under the condition of the rule 

(the minor) by means of the power of judgment. Finally, I determine my 

B36r cognition through the predicate of the rule (the conclusio),d hence a priori 
through reason. Thus the relatione between a cognition and its condition, 
which the major premise represents as the rule, constitutes the different 
kinds of syllogisms. They are therefore threefold -just as are all 
judgments in generalr-insofar as they are distinguished by the way they 
express the relationf of cognition to the understanding: namely, categorical 
or hypothetical or disjunctive syllogisms.9 

If, as happens for the most part, the conclusion is a judgment given 
as the problem,g in order to see whether it flows from already given 
judgments, through which, namely, a wholly different object is thought, 
then I seek whether the assertion of this conclusion is not to be found 
in the understanding under certain conditions according to a universal 

A305 rule. Now if! find such a condition and if the objecth of the conclusion 
can be subsumed under the given condition, then this conclusion is derived 
from the rule that is also valid for other objects of cognition. 
From this we see that reason, in inferring, seeks to bring the greatest 
manifold of cognition of the understanding to the smallest number of 
principles (universal conditions), and thereby to effect the highest unity 
of that manifold.

Introduction 

reason only a merely subordinate a faculty that gives to given cognitions 
a certain form, called "logical" form, through which cognitions of the 
understanding are subordinated to one another, and lower rules are 
subordinated to higher ones (whose condition includes the condition of 
the lower rules in its sphere), as far as this can be effected through comparing 
them? This is the question with which we will now concern ourselves, 
though only provisionally. In fact the manifold of rules and the 
unity of principles is a demand of reason, in order to bring the understanding 
into thoroughgoing connection with itself, just as the understanding 
brings the manifold of intuition under concepts and through 
them into connection.1O Yet such a principleb does not prescribe any law A306 
to objects/ and does not contain the ground of the possibility of cognizing 
and determining them as such in general, but rather is merely a 
subjective law of economy for the provision of our understanding, so 
that through comparison of its concepts it may bring their universal use 
to the smallest number, without justifYing us in demanding of objects 
themselves any such unanimity as might make things easier for our un-B 363 
derstanding or help it extend itself, and so give objective validity to its 
maxims as well. In a word, the question is: Does reason in itself, i.e., 
pure reason, contain a priori synthetic principlesd and rules, and in what 
might such principles consist? 

The formal and logical procedure of reason in syllogisms already 
gives us sufficient guidance as to where the ground of its transcendental 
principle' will rest in synthetic cognition through pure reason. 

First, the syllogism does not deal with intuitions, in order to bring 
them under rules (as does the understanding with its categories), but 
rather deals with concepts and judgments. If, therefore, pure reason 
also deals with objects, yet it has no immediate reference to them and 
their intuition, but deals only with the understanding and its judgments, 
which apply directly to the senses and their intuition, in order to deter-A307 
mine their object. The unity of reason is therefore not the unity of a 
possible experience, but is essentially different from that, which is the 
unity of understanding. That everything which happens must have a 
cause is not a principle! cognized and prescribed through reason at all. 
It makes the unity of experience possible and borrows nothing from 
reason, which could not have imposed any such synthetic unity from B 364 
mere concepts without this reference to possible experience. 

Second, reason in its logical use seeks the universal condition of its

judgment (its conclusion), and the syllogism is nothing but a judgment 
mediated by the subsumption of its condition under a universal rule 
(the major premise). Now since this rule is once again exposed to this 
same attempt of reason, and the condition of its condition thereby has 
to be sought (by means of a prosyllogism) as far as we may, we see very 
well that the proper principle of reason in general (in its logical use) is 
to find the unconditioned for conditioned cognitions of the understanding, 
with which its unity will be completed. 

But this logical maxim cannot become a principleb of pure reason unless 
we assume that when the conditioned is given, then so is the whole 
series of conditions subordinated one to the other, which is itself unconditioned, 
also given (i.e., contained in the object and its connection). 

Such a principle< of pure reason, however, is obviously synthetic; for 
the conditioned is analytically related to some condition, but not to the 
unconditioned. Different synthetic propositions must arise from it, of 
which the pure understanding knows nothing, since it has to do only 
with objects of a possible experience, whose cognition and synthesis are 
always conditioned. But the unconditioned, if it actually occurs, isd particularly 
to be considered according to all the determinations that distinguish 
it from everything conditioned, and must thereby give us 
material for many synthetic propositions a priori. 

The principlese arising from this supreme principle of pure reason 
will, however, be transcendent in respect of all appearances, i.e., no adequate 
empirical use can ever be made of that principle. It will therefore 
be entirely distinct from all principles! of the understanding 
(whose use is completely immanent, insofar as it has only the possibility 
of experience as its theme). But whether the principleg that the series 
of conditions (in the synthesis of appearances, or even in the 
thinking of things in general) reaches to the unconditioned, has objective 
correctness or not; what consequences flow from it for the empiri-

A309 cal use of the understanding, or whether it rather yields no such objectively 
valid propositions of at all, but is only a logical prescription in the 
ascent to ever higher conditions to approach completeness in them and 
thus to bring the highest possible unity of reason into our cognition; 
whether, I say, this need of reason has, through a misunderstanding, 

B 366 been taken for a transcendental principleh of reason, which overhastily

Introduction 

postulates such an unlimited completeness in the series of conditions in 
the objects themselves; but in this case what other kinds of misinterpretations 
and delusionso may have crept into the inferences of reason 
whose major premise (and that perhaps more a petition than a postulate) 
is taken from pure reason and ascends from experience to its conditions: 
All this will be our concern in the transcendental dialectic, 
which we will now develop from its sources hidden deep in human reason. 
We will divide it into two main parts, the first of which will treat 
of the transcendent concepts of pure reason, and the second of reason's 
transcendent and dialectical inferences of reason.b

Transcendental Dialectic 
First Book 
On the concepts of pure reason. 
However it may be with the possibility of concepts from pure reason, 
they are not merely reflected concepts but inferred concepts. Concepts 

B 367 of the understanding are also thought a priori before experience and on 
behalf of it; but they contain nothing beyond the unity of reflection on 
appearances, insofar as these appearances are supposed to belong necessarily 
to a possible empirical consciousness. Through them alone is 
cognition, and determination of an object, possible. They also first give 
material for inferring, and no a priori concepts of objects precede them, 
from which they could be inferred. On the contrary, their objective reality 
is founded solely on the fact that because they constitute the intellectual 
form of all experience, it must always be possible to show their 
application in experience. 

The term "a concept of reason," however, already shows in a provisional 
way that such a concept will not let itself be limited to experience, 
A 3 I I because it deals with a cognition (perhaps the whole of possible experience 
or its empirical synthesis) of which the empirical is only one part; 
no actual experience is fully sufficient for it, but every experience belongs 
to it. Concepts of reason serve for comprehension, just as concepts 
of the understanding serve for understanding (of perceptions). If 
they contain the unconditioned, then they deal with something under 
which all experience belongs, but that is never itself an object of experience; 
something to which reason leads through its inferences, and by 
which reason estimates and measures the degree of its empirical use, 
but that never constitutes a member of the empirical synthesis. If despite 
this such concepts have objective validity, then they can be called 
conceptus ratiocinati a (correctly inferred concepts); but if not, they have 
at least been obtained by a surreptitious illusion of inference, and so 
might be called conceptus ratiocinantesb (sophistical concepts). Since, 
however, this can be made out only in the chapter on dialectical infer

ences, we will not take account of it yet, but just as we called the concepts 
of understanding "categories," we will ascribe a new name to the 
concepts of pure reason and call them "transcendental ideas," which 
term we now elucidate and justify. 

Firstbook of the transcendental dialectic A312 
Firstsection 
On the ideas in general. 


In the great wealth of our languages, the thinking mind nevertheless 
often finds itself at a loss for an expression that exactly suits its concept, 
and lacking this it is able to make itself rightly intelligible neither to 
others nor even to itself. Coining new words is a presumption to legis-B369 
late in language that rarely succeeds, and before we have recourse to 
this dubious means it is advisable to look around in a dead and learned 
language to see if an expression occurs in it that is suitable to this concept; 
and even if the ancient use of this expression has become somewhat 
unsteady owing to the inattentiveness of its authors, it is better to 
fix on the meaning" that is proper to it (even if it is doubtful whether it 
always had exactly this sense) than to ruin our enterprise by making 
ourselves unintelligible. 

For this reason, if there perhaps occurs only one single word for a 
certain concept that, in one meaning already introduced, exactly suits 
this concept, and if it is of great importance to distinguish it from other A3 I3 
related concepts, then it is advisable not to be prodigal with that word 
or use it merely as a synonym or an alternative in place of other words, 
but rather to preserve it carefully in its proper meaning; for it may otherwise 
easily happen that when the expression does not particularly occupy 
our attention but is lost in a heap of others having very divergent 
meaning, the thought which it alone can preserve may get lost as well. 

Plato made use of the expression idea in such a way that we can read-B 370 
ily see that he understood by it something that not only could never be 
borrowed from the senses, but that even goes far beyond the concepts 
of the understanding (with which Aristotle occupied himself), since 
nothing encountered in experience could ever be congruent to it.II 
Ideas for him are archetypes of things themselves, and not, like the categories, 
merely the key to possible experiences. In his opinion they 
flowed from the highest reason, through which human reason partakes 
in them; our reason, however, now no longer finds itself in its original 
state, but must call back with toil the old, now very obscure ideas 
through a recollection (which is called philosophy).12 I do not wish to

go into any literary investigation here, in order to make out the sense 


A314 which the sublime philosopher combined with his word. I note only 
that when we compare the thoughts that an author expresses about a 
subject, in ordinary speech as well as in writings, it is not at all unusual 
to find that we understand him even better than he understood himself, 
since he may not have determined his concept sufficiently and hence 
sometimes spoke, or even thought, contrary to his own intention. 

Plato noted very well that our power of cognition feels a far higher 
need than that of merely spelling out appearances according to a syn-

B371 thetic unity in order to be able to read them as experience, and that our 
reason naturally exalts itself to cognitions that go much too far for any 
object that experience can give ever to be congruent, but that nonetheless 
have their reality and are by no means merely figments of the 
brain. 

Plato found his ideas preeminently in everything that is practical,* i.e. 

A315 in what rests on freedom, which for its part stands under cognitions that 
are a proper product of reason. Whoever would draw the concepts of 
virtue from experience, whoever would make what can at best serve as 
an example for imperfect illustration into a model for a source of cognition 
(as many have actually done), would make of virtue an ambiguous 
non-entity, changeable with time and circumstances, useless for any 
sort of rule. On the contrary, we are all aware that when someone is 


B372 represented as a model of virtue, we always have the true original in our 
own mind alone, with which we compare this alleged model and according 
to which alone we estimate it. But it is this that is the idea of 
virtue, in regard to which all possible objects of experience do service as 
examples (proofs of the feasibility, to a certain degree, of what the concept 
of reason requires), but never as archetypes. That no human being 
will ever act adequately to what the pure idea of virtue contains does not 
prove in the least that there is something chimerical in this thought. 
For it is only by means of this idea that any judgment of moral worth 
or unworth is possible; and so it necessarily lies at the ground of every 
approach to moral perfection, even though the obstacles in human nature, 
as yet to be determined as to their degree, may hold us at a distance 
from it. 

A 3 14r/ B 371 * Of course he also extended his concept to speculative cognitions, whenever 
they were pure and given wholly a priori, and even to mathematics, even 
though mathematical cognitions have their object nowhere except in possible 
experience. Now I cannot follow him in this, just as little as I can in the mystical 
deduction of these ideas or in the exaggerated way in which he hypostatized 
them, as it were; although the lofty language that served him in this field 
is surely quite susceptible of a milder interpretation, and one that accords better 
with the nature of things. 

396 



Section 1. On the ideas in general 

The Platonic republic has become proverbial as a supposedly strik -A 3 16 
ing example of a dream of perfection that can have its place only in the 
idle thinker's brain; and Bruckerl3 finds it ridiculous for the philosopher 
to assert that a prince will never govern well unless he participates in 
the ideas. But we would do better to pursue this thought further, and (at 
those points where the excellent man leaves us without help) to shed 
light on it through new endeavors, rather than setting it aside as useless 
under the very wretched and harmful pretext of its impracticability. A B 373 
constitution providing for the greatest human freedom according to 
laws that permit the freedom of each to exist together with that of 
others (not one providing for the greatest happiness, since that would 
follow of itself) is at least a necessary idea, which one must make the 
ground not merely of the primary plan of a state's constitution but of all 
the laws too; and in it we must initially abstract from the present obstacles, 
which may perhaps arise not so much from what is unavoidable in 
human nature as rather from neglect of the true ideas in the giving of 
laws. For nothing is more harmful or less worthy of a philosopher than 
the vulgar appeal to allegedly contrary experience, which would not 
have existed at all if institutions had been established at the right time 
according to the ideas, instead of frustrating all good intentions by A 3 I 7 
using crude concepts in place of ideas, just because these concepts were 
drawn from experience. The more legislation and government agree 
with this idea, the less frequent punishment will become, and hence it 
is quite rational to assert (as Plato does) that in perfect institutional 
arrangements nothing of the sort would be necessary at all. 14 Even 
though this may never come to pass, the idea of this maximum is nevertheless 
wholly correct when it is set forth as an archetype, in order to B 374 
bring the legislative constitution of human beings ever nearer to a possible 
greatest perfection. For whatever might be the highest degree of 
perfection at which humanity must stop, and however great a gulf must 
remain between the idea and its execution, no one can or should try to 
determine this, just because it is freedom that can go beyond every proposed 
boundary. 

But Plato was right to see clear proofs of an origin in ideas not only 
where human reason shows true causality, and where ideas become efficient 
causes (of actions and their objects), namely in morality, but also 
in regard to nature itself.15 A plant, an animal, the regular arrangement 
of the world's structure (presumably thus also the whole order of nature) 
-these show clearly that they are possible only according to ideas; A3I8 
although no individual creature, under the individual conditions of its 
existence, is congruent with the idea of what is most perfect of its 
species (as little as a human being is congruent with the idea of humanity 
that he bears in his soul as the archetype of his actions), nevertheless 
these ideas :'-re in the highest understanding individual, unalterable, 


397 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Book I 

thoroughly determined, and the original causes of things, and only the 

B 375 whole its combination in the totality of a world is fully adequate to its 
idea. If we abstract from its exaggerated expression, then the philosopher's 
spiritual flight, which considers the physical copies a in the world 
order, and then ascends to their architectonic connection according to 
ends, i.e., ideas, is an endeavor that deserves respect and imitation; but 
in respect of that which pertains to principlesb of morality, legislation 
and religion where the ideas first make the experience (of the good) itself 
possible, even if they can never be fully expressed in experience, 
perform a wholly unique service, which goes unrecognized precisely because 
it is judged according to empirical rules, whose validity as principlese 
should be cancelled by those very ideas. For when we consider 
nature, experience provides us with the rule and is the source of truth; 
but with respect to moral laws, experience is (alas!) the mother of illu


A319 sion, and it is most reprehensible to derive the laws concerning what I 
ought to do from what is done, or to want to limit it to that. 
But instead of these matters, the prosecution of which in fact makes 
up the proper dignity of philosophy, we now concern ourselves with a 
labor less spectacular but nevertheless not unrewarding: that of making 

B 376 the terrain for these majestic moral edifices level and firm enough to be 
built upon; for under this ground there are all sorts of passageways, 
such as moles might have dug, left over from reason's vain but confident 
treasure hunting, that make every building insecure. It is the transcendental 
use of pure reason, of its principlesd and ideas, whose closer acquaintance 
we are now obligated to make, in order properly to 
determine and evaluate the influence and the worth of pure reason. Yet 
before I conclude this provisional introduction, I entreat those who take 
philosophy to heart (which means more than is commonly supposed), if 
they find themselves convinced by this and the following discussion, to 
take care to preserve the expression idea in its original meaning, so that 
it will not henceforth fall among the other expressions by which all sorts 
of representations are denoted in careless disorder, to the detriment of 
science. We are not so lacking in terms properly suited to each species 
of representation that we have need for one to encroach on the prop-


A320 erty of another. Here is their progression:e The genus is representation 
in general (repraesentatio). Under it stands the representation with 
consciousness (perceptio). A perception! that refers to the subject as a 
modification of its state is a sensation (sensatio); an objective percep

tion a is a cognition (cognitio). The latter is either an intuition or a con-B 377 
cept (intuitus vel conceptus). The former is immediately related to the 
object and is singular; the latter is mediate, by means of a mark, which 
can be common to several things. A concept is either an empirical or a 
pure concept, and the pure concept, insofar as it has its origin solely in 
the understanding (not in a pure image of sensibility), is called notio.b A 
concept made up of notions, which goes beyond the possibility of experience, 
is an idea or a concept of reason. Anyone who has become 
accustomed to this distinction must find it unbearable to hear a representation 
of the color red called an idea. It is not even to be called a notion 
(a concept of the understanding).'6 

First book of the transcendental dialectic A 321 
Second section 
On the transcendental ideas." 

The transcendental analytic gave us an example of how the mere logical 
form of our cognition can contain the origin of pure concepts a priori, 
which represent objects prior to all experience, or rather which 
indicate the synthetic unity that alone makes possible an empirical cog-B 378 
nition of objects. The form of judgments (transformed into a concept 
of the synthesis of intuitions) brought forth categories that direct all use 
of the understanding in experience. In the same way, we can expect that 
the form of the syllogisms, if applied to the synthetic unity of intuitions 
under the authority of the categories, will contain the origin of special 
concepts a priori that we may call pure concepts of reason or transcendental 
ideas, and they will determine the use of the understanding according 
to principlesd in the whole of an entire experience. 

The function of reason in its inferences consisted in the universality 
of cognition according to concepts, and the syllogism is itself a judgment 
determined a priori in the whole domain of its condition. I can A322 
draw the proposition "Caius is mortal" from experience merely through 
the understanding. But I seek a concept containing the condition under 
which the predicate (the assertion in general) of this judgment is given 
(i.e., here, the concept "human"), and after I have subsumed [the predicate] 
under this condition, taken in its whole domain ("all humans are 

a

b notion 
, In his copy of the first edition, Kant inserted these comments: 
"In experience we can [encounter] no concepts of reason, e.g., of the simple, which 
cannot exhibit any experience, the [absolutely] unconditioned of every kind. 
"The cosmological ideas, to be sure, pertain to objects [Objecte] of the sensible 
world, but .... " (the end of the manuscript is missing) (E CLII, p. 46; 23:38) 


d Principien

mortal"), I determine the cognition of my object according to it ("Caius 
is mortal"). 
Accordingly, in the conclusion of a syllogism we restrict a predicate 

B 379 to a certain object, after we have thought it in the major premise in its 
whole domain under a certain condition. This complete magnitude of 
the domain, in relation to such a condition, is called universality (universalitas). 
In the synthesis of intuition this corresponds to allness (universitas), 
or the totality of conditions. So the transcendental concept of 
reason is none other than that of the totality of conditions to a given 
conditioned thing. Now since the unconditioned alone makes possible 
the totality of conditions, and conversely the totality of conditions is always 
itself unconditioned, a pure concept of reason in general can be 
explaineda through the concept of the unconditioned, insofar as it contains 
a ground of synthesis for what is conditioned. 17 

A323 There will be as many concepts of reason as there are species of relationb 
represented by the understanding by means of the categories; and 
so we must seek an unconditioned, first, for the categorical synthesis 
in a subject, second for the hypothetical synthesis of the members of a 
series, and third for the disjunctive synthesis of the parts in a system. 18 

There are, therefore, just as many species of syllogism, and in each 
of them prosyllogisms proceed to the unconditioned: one, to a subject 
that is no longer a predicate, another to a presupposition that presup-

B 380 poses nothing further, and the third to an aggregate of members of a 
division such that nothing further is required for it to complete the division 
of a concept. Hence the pure rational concepts of the totality in 
a synthesis of conditions are necessary at least as problems of extending 
the unity of the understanding, if possible, to the unconditioned, 
and they are grounded in the nature of human reason, even if these 
transcendental concepts lack a suitable use in concreto and have no other 
utility than to point the understanding in the right direction so that it 
may be thoroughly consistent with itself when it extends itself to its uttennost 
extremes. 

A 324 However, while we are speaking here about the totality of conditions 
and the unconditioned, as the common title of all concepts of reason, we 
once again run up against an expression with which we cannot dispense 
and at the same time cannot safely use because of an ambiguity it has acquired 
through long misuse. The term absolute is one of the few words 
that in its original meaning was suited to one concept that by and large 
no other word in the same language precisely suits, and so its loss, or 
what is the same thing, its vacillating use, must carry with it the loss of 

B 381 the concept itself, but this is indeed a concept with which we cannot dis

Section II. On the transcendental ideas 

pense except at great disadvantage to all transcendental estimations.a 
The word absolute is now more often used merely to indicate that 
something is valid of a thingb considered in itself and thus internally. 
In this meaning, "absolutely possible" would signify what is possible in 
itself (internally), which is in fact the least one can say of an object. On 
the contrary, however, it is also sometimes used to indicate that something 
is valid in every relation (unlimitedly) (e.g., absolute dominion); 
and in this meaning absolutely possible would signify what is possible 
in all respects in every relation, which is again the most that I can say 
about the possibility of a thing. Now sometimes, to be sure, these two A325 
meanings coincide. So, for example, what is internally impossible is also 
impossible in every relation, and hence absolutely impossible. But in 
most cases they are infinitely far apart from each other, and so I can by 
no means infer that because something is possible in itself it is therefore 
also possible in every relation, hence absolutely possible. Indeed, in 
what follows I will show about absolute necessity that it by no means depends 
in all cases on what is internal, and so must not be regarded as signifying 
the same as what is internal. That whose opposite is internally B 382 
impossible, that whose opposite is clearly also impossible in all respects, 

is therefore itself absolutely necessary; but I cannot infer conversely that 
what is absolutely necessary is something whose opposite is internally 
impossible, i.e., that the absolute necessity of a thing is an internal necessity; 
for this "internal necessity" is in certain cases a wholly empty expression, 
with which we cannot connect the least concept; on the 
contrary, the concept of the necessity of a thing in every relation (to 
everything possible) carries with it very special determinations. Now because 
the loss of a concept that has great application in speculative philosophy 
can never be a matter of indifference to the philosopher, I hope 


he will also not be indifferent to carefully preserving the determination 
and the expression on which the concept depends. 

It is in this extended meaning that I will make use of the word ab-A326 
solute, opposing it to what is merely comparative, or valid in some particular 
respect; for the latter is restricted to conditions, while the former 
is valid without any restriction. 

Now a transcendental concept of reason always goes to the absolute 
totality in the synthesis of conditions, and never ends except with the 
absolutely unconditioned, i.e., what is unconditioned in every relation. 
For pure reason leaves to the understanding everything that relates directly 
to objects of intuition or rather to their synthesis in imagination. B 383 
It reserves for itself only the absolute totality in the use of concepts, and 
seeks to carry the synthetic unity, which is thought in the categories, all 

a Beurteilungen; in the third edition, this word is in the singular.

b Sacbe 


401

the way to the absolutely unconditioned. We can therefore call this the 
unity of reason in appearances, just as that which the category expresses 
can be called the unity of understanding. Thus reason relates 
itself only to the use of the understanding, not indeed insofar as the latter 
contains the ground of possible experience (for the absolute totality 
of conditions is not a concept that is usable in an experience, because no 
experience is unconditioned), but rather in order to prescribe the direction 
toward a certain unity of which the understanding has no concept, 
proceeding to comprehend all the actions of the understanding in 

A32 7 respect of every object into an absolute whole. Hence the objective use 
of the pure concepts of reason is always transcendent, while that of the 
pure concepts of understanding must by its nature always be immanent, 
since it is limited solely to possible experience. 
By the idea of a necessary concept of reason, I understand one to 
which no congruent object can be given in the senses. Thus the pure 
concepts of reason we have just examined are transcendental ideas. 

B 384 They are concepts of pure reason; for they consider all experiential 
cognition as determined through an absolute totality of conditions. 
They are not arbitrarily invented, but given as problemsa by the nature 
of reason itself, and hence they relate necessarily to the entire use of the 
understanding. Finally, they are transcendent concepts, and exceed the 
bounds of all experience, in which no object adequate to the transcendental 
idea can ever occur. When we call something an idea, we are saying 
a great deal about its objectb (as an object of pure understanding), 
but just for this reason very little about the subject (i.e., in respect of its 
actuality under empirical conditions), since, as the concept of a maximum, 
nothing congruent to it can ever be given in concreto. Now be-

A 32 8 cause in the merely speculative use of reason the latter is really the 
whole aim, and approaching a concept that will, however, never be 
reached in execution, is the same as simply lacking that concept, it is 
said of a concept of this sort that it is only an idea. Thus we might say 
that the absolute whole of appearances is only an idea, since, because 
we can never project it in an image, it remains a problemC without any 
solution. On the contrary, because in the practical use of understand-

B 385 ing it is only a matter of execution according to rules, an idea of practical 
reason can always be actually given in concreto, though only in part; 
indeed, it is the indispensable condition of every practical use of reason. 
Its execution is always bounded and defective, but within bounds 
that cannot be determined, hence always under the influence of the 
concept of an absolute completeness. Accordingly, the practical idea is 

a

402 



Section II. On the transcendental ideas 

always fruitful in the highest degree and unavoidably necessary in respect 
of actual actions. In it practical reason even has the causality actually 
to bring forth what its concept contains; and hence of such 
wisdom we cannot likewise say disparagingly: It is only an idea; rather 
just because it is the idea of a necessary unity of all possible ends, it 
must serve as a rule, the original and at least limiting condition, for 
everything practical. 

Although we have to say of the transcendental concepts of reason: A329 
They are only ideas, we will by no means regard them as superfluous 
and nugatory. For even if no object can be determined through them, 
they can still, in a fundamental and unnoticed way, serve the understanding 
as a canon for its extended and self-consistent use, through 
which it cognizes no more objects than it would cognize through its 
concepts, yet in this cognition it will be guided better and further. Not 
to mention the fact that perhaps the ideas make possible a transition B 386 
from concepts of nature to the practical, and themselves generate support 
for the moral ideas and connection with the speculative cognitions 
of reason. About all this we must expect to be informed in due course. 

But given our present aims, we will set aside the practical ideas, and 
hence consider reason only in its speculative use, and in this even more 
narrowly, namely only in its transcendental use. Here we must strike 
out on the same path as we took above in the deduction of the categories; 
that is, we must consider the logical form of rational cognition, 
and see whether in this way reason will not perhaps also be a source of 
concepts, regarding objectsa in themselves as determined synthetically 
a priori in respect of one or another function of reason. 

Reason, considered as the faculty of a certain logical form of cogni-A330 
tion, is the faculty of inferring, i.e., of judging mediately (through the 
subsumption of a condition of a possible judgment under the condition 
of something given). The given judgment is the universal rule (major 
premise, major). The subsumption of the condition of another possible 
judgment under the condition of the rule is the minor premise (minor). 
The actual judgment that expresses the assertion of the rule in the subsumed 
caseb is the conclusion (conclusio). The rule says something uni-B 387 
versal under a certain condition. Now in a case that comes before us the 
condition of the rule obtains. Thus what is valid universally under that 
condition is also to be regarded as valid in the case before us (which carries 
this condition with it). We easily see that reason attains to a cognition 
through actions of the understanding that constitute a series of 
conditions. Thus suppose I arrive at the proposition "All bodies are alterable" 
only by beginning with the more remote cognition (in which 

a Objecte 

b The fourth edition reads "to the subsumed case." 


403 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Book I 

the concept of a body does not occur, but that contains the condition of 
this concept) that "Everything composite is alterable," and go from 
this to a closer proposition standing under the condition of the former: 
"Bodies are composite"; and then from this finally to a third proposition, 
conjoining the more distant cognition ("alterable") with the one 

A331 lying before us: "Consequently, bodies are alterable"; then I arrive at a 
cognition (a conclusion) through a series of conditions (premises). Now 
every series whose exponent (whether that of the categorical or the hypothetical 
judgment) is given may be continued; hence the very same 
action of reason leads to a ratiocinatio prosyllogistica, a which is a series of 
inferences, that can be continued to an indeterminate extent either on 
the side of the conditions (per prosyllogismos)b or on the side of the conditioned 
(per episyllogismos).c 
But we soon come to be aware that the chain or series of prosyllogisms, 
i.e., of inferred cognitions on the side of the grounds, or of the 
conditions of a given cognition -in other words, the ascending series 
of syllogisms -has to be related to the faculty of reason differently from 
the descending series, i.e., the progression of reason on the side of 
that which is conditioned through episyllogisms. For since in the first 
case the cognition (the conclusio) is given only as conditioned, we cannot 
reach it by means of reason except at least on the presupposition that all 
members of the series are given on the side of the conditions (totality in 
the series of premises), because only under this presupposition is the 
judgment before us possible a priori; on the contrary, on the side of that 
which is conditioned or of the consequences, there is thought only a series 
that becomes, and that is not already presupposed or given as a 
whole, and so only a potential progression. Hence if a cognition is regarded 
as conditioned, reason is necessitated to regard the series of conditions 
in an ascending line as completed and given in their totality. But 
if the very same cognition is at the same time regarded as a condition of 
other cognitions that constitute a series of consequences in a descending 
line, then reason can be entirely indifferent about how far this progression 
stretches a parte posteriori, and whether a totality of these 
conditions is even possible at all; for it does not need a series of the 
same sort for the conclusion that lies before us, since this conclusion is 
already sufficiently determined and secured through its grounds a parte 
priori. Now it mayror may not be that on the side of the conditions, the 
series of premises has a first [member] as the supreme condition, and 
hence that it is without bound a parte priori; nevertheless it must still

a desired conclusion.

contain the totality of the condition, assuming that we could never succeed 
in grasping it; and the whole series must be unconditionally true if 
the conditioned, which is regarded as a consequence arising from it, is 
supposed to count as true. This is a demand of reason, which declares 
its cognition to be determined a priori and necessary either as it is in itself 
-in which case it needs no grounds -or else -if it is derived -as a 
member of a series of grounds that is itself unconditionally true. 

The first book of the transcendental dialectic 
Third section 
The system of the transcendental ideas. 


What we have to do with here is not a logical dialectic that abstracts 
from every content of cognition and merely discovers false illusion in 
the form of syllogisms, but rather a transcendental dialectic, that, fully 
a priori, is supposed to contain both the origin of certain cognitions 
from pure reason and inferred concepts, whose object cannot be given 
empirically at all, and so lies wholly outside the faculty of the pure understanding. 
We have gathered from the natural relation that the transcendental 
use of our cognition must have in its inferences as well as in 
its judgments that there will be only three species of dialectical inferences, 
relating to the three species of inference by which reason can arrive 
at cognitions from principles;a and that in everything the concern 
of reason is to ascend from the conditioned synthesis, to which the understanding 
always remains bound, toward the unconditioned, which 
the understanding can never reach. 

Now what is universal in every relation that our representations can 
have is r) the relation to the subject, 2) the relation to objects, b and inB391 
deed either asC appearances, or as objects of thinking in general. If we A334 
combine this subdivision with the above division, then all the relationd 
of representations of which we can make either a concept or an idea are 
of three sorts: I) the relatione to the subject, 2) to the manifold of the 
object! in appearance, and 3) to all things in general.'9 

Now all pure concepts have to do generally with the synthetic unity 
of representations, but concepts of pure reason (transcendental ideas) 
have to do with the unconditioned synthetic unity of all conditions in 
general. Consequently, all transcendental ideas will be brought under

three classes, of which the first contains the absolute (unconditioned) 
unity of the thinking subject, the second the absolute unity of the series 
of conditions of appearance, the third the absolute unity of the 
condition of all objects of thought in general. 

The thinking subject is the object of psychology, the sum total of all 
appearances (the world) is the object of cosmology, and the thing that 
contains the supreme condition of the possibility of everything that can 
be thought (the being of all beings) is the object of theology.zo Thus 
pure reason provides the ideas for a transcendental doctrine of the soul 
(psychologia rationalis),a a transcendental science of the world (cosmologia 
rationalis),b and finally also a transcendental cognition of God (theologia 
transcendentalis). c Even so much as the mere sketch of these sciences is 
not prescribed by the understanding, even if it is combined with the 
highest logical use of reason, i.e., with all the inferences through which 
we can think of progressing from an object of the understanding (appearance) 
to all other objects, even to the most distant members of the 
empirical synthesis; rather, such a project is exclusively a pure and genuine 
product or problemd of pure reason. 

What modi of pure rational concepts stand under these three titles of 
transcendental ideas will be finally displayed in the following sections. 
They run along the thread of the categories. For pure reason is never 
related directly to objects, but instead to concepts of them given by the 
understanding. Likewise, it can be made clear only in the complete execution 
how reason, exclusively through the synthetic use of the same 
function it employs in the categorical syllogism, must necessarily come 
to the concept of the absolute unity of the thinking subject, how 
the logical procedure in hypothetical syllogisms e [leads to] the ideas of 
the absolutely unconditioned in a series of given conditions, and finally 
how the mere form of the disjunctive syllogism necessarily carries with 
it the highest rational concept of a being of all beings; a thought which 
at first glance appears extremely paradoxical. 

No objective deduction of these transcendental ideas is really possible, 
such as we could provide for the categories. For just because they 
are ideas, they have in fact no relation to any object! that could be given 
congruent to them. But we can undertake a subjective introduction t􀝟

them from the nature of our reason, and this is to be accomplished in 
the present section. 

We easily see that pure reason has no other aim than the absolute totality 
of synthesis on the side of conditions (whether they are conditions 
of inherence, dependence, or concurrence), and that reason has 
nothing to do with absolute completeness from the side of the conditioned. 
For it needs only the former series in order to presuppose the 
whole series of conditions and thereby give it to the understanding a 
priori. But once a complete (and unconditioned) given condition exists, 
then a concept of reason is no longer needed in respect of the progress 
of the series; for the understanding by itself makes every step downwards 
from the condition to the conditioned. In this way, the tran-B 394 
scendental ideas serve only for ascending in the series of conditions to 
the unconditioned, i.e., to the principles.a But regarding descent to the 
conditioned, there is a very extensive logical use that our reason makes A 3 3 7 
of the laws of the understanding, but no transcendental use and if we 
make ourselves an idea of absolute totality of such a synthesis (of a progressive 
one), e.g., an idea of the whole series of all future alterations 
in the world, then this is just a thing of thought (an ens rationis),b which 
is thought up only arbitrarily, and not presupposed necessarily by reason. 
For the possibility of something conditioned presupposes the totality 
of its conditions, but not the totality of its consequences. 
Consequently such a concept is not a transcendental idea, which is what 
exclusively concerns us here. 


Finally we also come to be aware that a certain connection and unity 
showing itself among the transcendental ideas tl1emselves and that pure 
reason by means of it brings all its cognitions into a system. To progress 
from the cognition of oneself (of the soul) to cognition of the world 
and, by means of this, to the original being, is so natural that this progression 
appears similar to the logical advance of reason from premises B 395 
to a conclusion.* Whether there is actually here an affinity of the same 

* c<Metaphysics has as the proper end of its investigation only three ideas: God, B 395 
freedom, and immortality; so that the second concept, combined with the 
first, should lead to the third as a necessary conclusion. Everything else with 
which this science is concerned serves merely as a means of attaining these 
ideas and their reality. It does not need them for the sake of natural science, but 
instead to get beyond nature. The insight into these ideas would make theology, 
morals, and, through their combination, religion, thus the highest ends 
of our existence, dependent solely on the faculty of speculative reason and on 
nothing else. In a systematic representation of those ideas, the suggested order,

kind that grounds the logical and transcendental procedures is one of 
the questions we must expect to answer in the course of our investigation. 
We have provisionally reached our end already, since we have removed 
from this ambiguous position the transcendental concepts of 
reason, which are usually mixed with other concepts in the theories of 
philosophers who do not distinguish them from concepts of the understanding, 
and thereby provided their determinate number, since there 
can never be any more of them, and we have been able to represent 
them in a systematic connection, through which a special field of pure 
reason has been marked out and its limits have been set. 

which is a synthetic one, would be the most appropriate; but in working 
through them, which must necessarily be done first, the analytic order, which 
inverts this one, is more suitable to the end of completing our great project, 
proceeding from what experience makes immediately available to us from the 
doctrine of the soul, to the doctrine of the world and from there all the way 
to the cognition of God.>

The dialectical inferences of pure reason 
The Transcendental Dialectic 
Book Two 
The dialectical inferences of pure reason 
It can be said that the object of a merely transcendental idea is something 
of which we have no concept, even though this idea is generated 
in an entirely necessary way by reason according to its original laws. For 
in fact no concept of the understanding is possible for an object that is 
to be adequate to the demand of reason, i.e., an object such as can be 
shown and made intuitive in a possible experience. But we would exA339 
press ourselves better and with less danger of misunderstanding if we Br397 
said that we can have no acquaintance with an objecta that corresponds 
to an idea, even though we can have a problematic concept of it. 

Now at least the transcendental (subjective) reality of pure concepts 
of reason rests on the fact that we are brought to such ideas by a necessary 
syllogism. Thus there will be syllogisms containing no empirical 
premises, by means of which we can infer from something with which 
we are acquainted to something of which we have no concept, and yet 
to which we nevertheless, by an unavoidable illusion, give objective reality. 
In respect of their result, such inferences are thus to be called sophistical 
rather than rational inferences; b even though they might lay 
claim to the latter term on account of what occasions them, because 
they are not thought up, nor do they arise contingently, but have sprung 
from the nature of reason. They are sophistriesc not of human beings 
but of pure reason itself, and even the wisest of all human beings cannot 
get free of them; perhaps after much effort he may guard himself 
from error, but he can never be wholly rid of the illusion, which ceaselessly 
teases and mocks him. 

There are, therefore, only three species of these dialectical syllogisms, 
as many as there are ideas in which their conclusions result. In 
the first class of syllogisms, from the transcendental concept of a sub



ject that contains nothing manifold I infer the absolute unity of this

subject itself, even though in this way I have no concept at all of it. This 
dialectical inference I will call a transcendental paralogism. The second 
class of sophistical inference is applied in general to the transcendental 
concept of absolute totality in the series of conditions for a given 
appearance; and from the fact that I always have a self-contradictory 
concept of the unconditioned synthetic unity in the series on one side, 
I infer the correctness of the opposite unity, even though I also have no 
concept of it. I will call the condition of reason with regard to these dialectical 
inferences the antinomy of pure reason. Finally, in the third 
kind of sophistical inference, from the totality of conditions for thinking 
objects in general insofar as they can be given to me I infer the absolute 
synthetic unity of all conditions for the possibility of things in 
general; i.e., from things with which I am not acquainted as to their 
merely transcendental concept, I infer a being of all beings, with which 
I am even less acquainted through its transcendental a concept, and of 
whose unconditioned necessity I can make for myself no concept at all. 
This dialectical syllogism I will call the ideal of pure reason.

The paralogisms of pure reasona 
A logical paralogism consists in the falsity of a syllogism due to its form, 
whatever its content may otherwise be. A transcendental paralogism, 
however, has a transcendental ground for inferring falsely due to its 
form.2I Thus a fallacy of this kind will have its ground in the nature of 
human reason, and will bring with it an unavoidable, although not insoluble, 
illusion. 

Now we come to a concept that was not catalogued above in the generalrlist 
of transcendental concepts, and nevertheless must be assigned 
to it, yet without altering that table in the least and declaring it defective. 
This is the concept -or rather, if one prefers, the judgment -I 
think. But one will easily see that this concept is the vehicle of all concepts 
whatever, and hence also of transcendental concepts, and is thus 
always comprehended among them, and hence is likewise transcendental, 
but that it can have no special title, because it serves only to intro


a Note added to Kant's copy of the first edition: "The question is whether, if 1 cognize a 
transcendental object [Object] (I) througb pure categories, without otherwise having any 
properties of it, 1 thereby actually cognize it or have only a negative concept of it. 
Further, whether these categories could be cognized through perception regarding this 
object, or whether they lie apriori in thinking in general. Third, whether through these 
cognition would be extended." (E CLN, p. 47; 23:38; cf. A 59z1B 620) 

"A paralogism is a syllogism that is false informa. Now it also belongs to the form 
that the major is a universal proposition, and also that the premises are not tautological. 
But here the major is a singular judgment and contains a tautology in itself. 
Consequently, the syllogism has only two termini." (E CLV; p. 47, 23:38) 

"The paralogisms begin from existence as modality: 'I am'; proceed to relation 
[Relation] in order to determine existence not in time, which would be empirical. 
Therefore: 1 am as substance, simple as to quality, identical in my duration. The time 
of my duration is thus the time of my own self-determination." (E CLVI, p. 47; 
2 Fl8-9; cf. B 4I8) 

"The proposition 'a exists,' is a simple substance, always the same, must in other 
cases be cognized through marks: 1. of perception, at least in time; 2. through properties 
that are persisting; 3· through demonstration of their [parts] in space and time; 4. 
through perception. Here I, as it were, [have sensation of] the categories or know them 
a priori." (E CLVII, p. 48; 23'39)

ducea all thinking as belonging to consciousness. Meanwhile, however 
pure from the empirical (from impressions of sense) it may be, it still 
serves to distinguish two kinds of objects through the nature of our 
power of representation. I, as thinking, am an object of inner sense, and 
am called "soul." That which is an object of outer sense is called "body." 
Accordingly, the expression "I," as a thinking being, already signifies 
the object of a psychology that could be called the rational doctrine of 
the soul, if I do not seek to know anything about the soul beyond what, 
independently of all experience (which always determines me more 
closely and in concreto), can be inferred from this concept I insofar as it 
occurs in all thinking. 

Now the rational doctrine of the SOUP2 is really an undertaking of 
this kind; for if the least bit of anything empirical in my thinking, any 
particular perception of my inner state, were mixed among the 
grounds of cognition of this science, then it would no longer be a rational 
but rather an empirical doctrine of the soul. We have thus already 
before us a putative science, which is built on the single 
proposition I think; and we can, in accordance with the nature of a 
transcendental philosophy, quite appropriately investigate its ground 
or groundlessness. One should not be brought up short by the fact that 
I have an inner experience of this proposition, which expresses the perception 
of oneself, and hence that the rational doctrine of the soul that 
is built on it is never pure but is grounded in part on an empirical principle.
b For this inner perception is nothing beyond the mere apperception 
I think, which even makes all transcendental concepts possible, 
which say "I think substance, cause, etc."c For inner experience in general 
and its possibility, or perception in general and its relationd to another 
perception, without any particular distinction or empirical 
determination being given in it, cannot be regarded as empirical cognition, 
but must be regarded as cognition of the empirical in general, 
and belongs to the investigation of the possibility of every experience, 
which is of course transcendental. The least objecte of perception (e.g.,

sentation of self-consciousness, would at once transform rational psychology 
into an empirical psychology. 

I thinka is thus the sole text of rational psychology, from which it is 
to develop its entire wisdom. One easily sees that this thought, if it is to 
be related to an object (myself), can contain nothing other than its transcendental 
predicates; because the least empirical predicate would corrupt 
the rational purity and independence of the science from all 
experience. 

Here, however, we have merely to follow the guide of the categories; A 344/ B402 
only since here first a thing, I as a thinking being, is given, we will not, 
to be sure, alter the above order of the categories to one another as represented 
in their table, but we will begin here with the category of substance, 
and thus go backwards through the series. The topics of the 
rational doctrine of the soul, from which everything else that it may 
contain has to be derived, are therefore the following:

* The reader, who will not so easily guess from these expressions in their transcendental 
abstraction, their psychological sense and why the ultimate attribute 
of the soul belongs to the category of existence, will find this adequately 
explained and justified in what follows. Besides, on account of the 
Latin expressions that, contrary to good taste in writing, have inundated us 
here in place of equivalent German ones, in this section as well as in the whole 
work, I must adduce the following by way of apology: I would rather lose 
something by way of elegance of language than make scholastic usage even 
more difficult through the least unintelligibility. 
a Note in Kant's copy of the first edition: "[This] is a proposition apriori, is a mere category 
of the subject, intellectual representation without anywhere or at any time, hence 
not empirical. Whether the category of reality lies in it, whether objective inferences 
are to be drawn from it." (E CLX, p. 48; 23:39)

CLXI, p. 49).

Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. Bk. II 

A345/B403 From these elements, at least through composition, spring all the 
concepts of the pure doctrine of the soul, without any other principlea 
being cognized in the least. This substance, merely as an object of inner 
sense, gives us the concept of immateriality; as simple substance, it 
gives us that of incorruptibility; its identity, as an intellectual substance, 
gives us personality; all these points together give us spirituality; 
the relationb to objects in space gives us the interactionc with 
bodies; thus it represents the thinking substance as the principled of life 
in matter, i.e., as a soul (anima) and as the ground of animality, and 
this -limited by spirituality -is immortality. 
Now to these concepts four paralogisms of a transcendental doctrine 
of the soul are related, which are falsely held to be a science of pure reaB404 
son about the nature of our thinking being. At the ground of this doctrine 
we can place nothing but the simple and in content for itself 
A 346 wholly empty representation I, of which one cannot even say that it is 
a concept, but a mere consciousness that accompanies every concept. 
Through this I, or He, or It (the thing), which thinks, nothing further 
is represented than a transcendental subject of thoughts = x, e which is 
recognized only through the thoughts that are its predicates, and about 
which, in abstraction, we can never have even the least concept; because 
ofwhich we therefore turn in a constant circle, since we must always already 
avail ourselves of the representation of it at all times in order to 
judge anything about it; we cannot separate ourselves from this inconvenience, 
because the consciousness in itself is not even a representation 
distinguishing a particular object! but rather a form of representation 
in general, insofar as it is to be called a cognition; for of itg alone 
can I say that through it I think anything. 
But right at the start it must seem strange that the condition under 
which I think in general, and which is therefore merely a propertyh of 
my subject, is at the same time to be valid for everything that thinks, and 
that on an empirical-seeming proposition we can presume to ground an 
apodictic and universal judgment, namely, that everything that thinks is 
constituted as the claim of self-consciousness asserts of me. But the cause 
B405 of this lies in the fact that we must necessarily ascribe to things a priori

all the properties that constitute the conditions under which alone we A 347 
think them. Now 1 cannot have the least representation of a thinking 
being through an external experience, but only through self-consciousness. 
Thus such objects are nothing further than the transference of this 
consciousness of mine to other things, which can be represented as 
thinking beings only in this way. The proposition "I think" is, however, 
taken here only problematically; not insofar as it may contain a perception 
of an existence (the Cartesian cogito, ergo sum),a but only in its mere 
possibility, in order to see which properties might flow from so simple a 
proposition as this for its subject (whether or not such a thing might now 
exist). 

If more than the cogitob were the ground of our pure rational cognition 
of thinking beings in general; if we also made use of observations 
about the play of our thoughts and the natural laws of the thinking self 
created from them: then an empirical psychology would arise, which 
would be a species of the physiology of inner sense, which would perhaps 
explain the appearances of inner sense, but could never serve to reveal 
such properties as do not belong to possible experience at all (as 
properties of the simple), nor could it serve to teach apodictically B406 
about thinking beings in general something touching on their nature; 
thus it would be no rational psychology. 

Now since the proposition I think (taken problematically) contains A348 
the form of every judgment of understanding whatever and accompanies 
all categories as their vehicle, it is clear that the conclusions from 
this can contain a merely transcendental use of the understanding, 
which excludes every admixture of experience; and ofc whose progress, 
after what we have shown above, we can at the start form no advantageous 
concept. Thus we will follow it through all the predications of the 
pure doctrine of the soul with a critical eye.d

judgments, and this representation of Myselfa cannot be used as the 
predicate of any other thing. 
Thus I, as thinking being (soul), am substance.23 

Criticism of the first paralogism 
of pure psychology. 

We have shown in the analytical part of the Transcendental Logic that 
pure categories (and among them also the category of substance) have 
in themselves no objective significance at all unless an intuition is sub-

A349 sumed underb them, to the manifold of which they can be applied as 
functions of synthetic unity. Without that they are merely functions of 
a judgment without content. Of any thing in general I can say that it is 
a substance, insofar as I distinguish it from mere predicates and determinations 
of things. Now in all our thinking the I is the subject, in 
which thoughts inhere only as determinations, and this I cannot be used 
as the determination of another thing. Thus everyone must necessarily 
regard Himself as a substance, but regard his thinking only as accidents 
of his existence and determinations of his state. 
But now what sort of use am I to make of this concept of a substance?' 
That I, as a thinking being, endured for myself, that naturally 
I neither arise nor perish -this I can by no means infer, and yet it is 
for that alone that the concept of the substantiality of my thinking subject 
can be useful to me; without that I could very well dispense with it 
altogether. 
So much is lacking for us to be able to infer these properties solely 
from the pure category of substance, that we must rather ground the 
persistence of a given object on experience if we would apply to that object 
the empirically usable concept of a substance. But now we have not 
grounded the present proposition on any experience, but have merely 

A 350 inferred [it] from the concept of the relation that all thought has to the 
I as the common subject in which it inheres. Nor would we be able to 
establish such a persistence through any secure observation, even if we 
supposed one. For the I is, to be sure, in all thoughts; but not the least 
intuition is bound up with this representation, which would distinguish 
it from other objects of intuition. Therefore one can, to be sure, perceive 
that this representation continually recurs with every thought, but 

a Mir selbst, the capitalization is nonstandard, suggesting that "Mir" is a noun rather than 
a pronoun; changed to mir selbst in fourth edition. Below capitalizations of "Me," 
"Myself," "Self," "Himself," etc., will be used to translate similar nonstandard capitalizations 
in Kant's German.

not that it is a standing and abiding intuition, in which thoughts (as 
variable) would change. 

From this it follows that the first syllogism of transcendental psychology 
imposes on us an only allegedly new insight when it passes off the 
constant logical subject of thinking as the cognition of a real subject of 
inherence, with which we do not and cannot have the least acquaintance, 
because consciousness is the one single thing that makes all representations 
into thoughts, and in which, therefore, as in the transcendental 
subject, our perceptions must be encountered; and apart from this logical 
significance of the I, we have no acquaintance with the subject in itself 
that grOlmds this I as a substratum, just as it grounds all thoughts. 
Meanwhile, one can quite well allow the proposition The soul is substance 
to be valid, if only one admits that this concept of ours leads no 
further, that it cannot teach us any of the usual conclusions of the ratio-A 3 5 I 
nalistic doctrine of the soul, such as, e.g., the everlasting duration of the 
soul through all alterations, even the human being's death, thus that it 
signifies a substance only in the idea but not in reality. 

Second paralogism 
of simplicity. 

That thing whose action can never be regarded as the concurrence of 

many acting things, is simple. 
Now the soul, or the thinking I, is such a thing. 
Thus etc.24 

Criticism of the second paralogism 
of transcendental psychology. 

This is the Achilles of all the dialectical inferences of the pure doctrine 
of the soul, nothing like a mere sophistical play that a dogmatist devised 
in order to give his assertions a fleeting plausibility,a but an inference 
that seemsb to withstand even the sharpest testing and the greatest scruples 
of inquiry. Here it is. 

Every composite substance is an aggregate of many, and the action 
of a composite, or of that which inheres in it as such a composite, is an 
aggregate of many actions or accidents, which is distributed among the 
multitudeC of substances. Now of course an effect that arises from the 
concurrence of many acting substances is possible if this effect is merely A 3 5 2 
external (as, e.g., the movement of a body is the united movement of all 

a Schein 

b scheint 
, Menge 
417 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. Bk. II <A> 

its parts). Yet with thoughts, as accidents belonging inwardly to a thinking 
being, it is otherwise. For suppose that the composite were thinking; 
then every part of it would be a part of the thought, but the parts 
would first contain the whole thought only when taken together. Now 
this would be contradictory. For because the representations that are div:ided 
among different beings (e.g., the individual words of a verse) 
never constitute a whole thought (a verse), the thought can never inhere 
in a composite as such.25 Thus it is possible only in one substance, 
which is not an aggregate of many, and hence it is absolutely simple. * 

The so-called nervus probandi a of this argument lies in the proposition 
that many representations have to be contained in the absolute unity of 
the thinking subject in order to constitute one thought. But no one can 
prove this proposition from concepts. For how could he set about to 

A353 accomplish this? The proposition "A thought can be only the effect of 
the absolute unity of a thinking being" cannot be treated as analytic. 
For the unity of a thought consisting of many representations is collective, 
and, as far as mere concepts are concerned, it can be related to the 
collective unity of the substances cooperating in it (as the movement of 
a body is the composite movement of all its parts) just as easily as to the 
absolute unity of the subject. Thus there can be no insight into the necessity 
of presupposing a simple substance for a composite thought according 
to the rule of identity. But that this same proposition should be 
cognized synthetically and fully a priori from sheer concepts -that answer 
no one will trust himself to give when he has insight into the 
ground of the possibility of synthetic propositions a priori as we have established 
it above. 
But now it is also impossible to derive this necessary unity of the subject, 
as a condition of the possibility of every thought, from experience. 
For experience gives us cognition of no necessity, to say nothing of the 
fact that the concept of absolute unity is far above its sphere. Where, 
then, will we get this proposition, on which the whole psychological 
syllogism rests? 


It is obvious that if one wants to represent a thinking being, one must 
put oneself in its place, and thus substitute one's own subject for the obA354 
jectb one wants to consider (which is not the case in any other species 
of investigation); and it is also obvious that we demand absolute unity 
for the subject of a thought only because otherwise it could not be said: 

A352 * It is very easy to give this proof the usual dress of scholastic precision. Yet it 
is sufficient for my purpose to lay before our eyes the mere ground of proof, 
though in a popular manner .

b Object 


418 


Chapter I. On the paralogisms of pure reason <A> 

"I think" (the manifold in a representation). For although the whole of 
the thought could be divided and distributed among many subjects, the 
subjective I cannot be divided or distributed, and this I we presuppose 
in all thinking. 

Here, therefore, as in the previous paralogism, the formal proposition 
of apperception, I think, remains the entire ground on which rational 
psychology ventures to extend its cognitions; this proposition is 
of course obviously not an experience, but rather the form of apperception, 
on which every experience depends and which precedes it, yet it 
must nevertheless always be regarded only in regarda to a possible cognition 
in general, as its merely subjective condition, which we unjustly 
make into a condition of the possibility of the cognition of 
objects, namely into a concept of a thinking being in general, because 
we are unable to represent this being without positing ourselves along 
witll the formula of our consciousness, in the place of every other intelligent 
being. 

But the simplicity of my self (as soul) is not really inferred from the 
proposition "I think," but rather the former lies already in every thought 
itself. The proposition I am simple must be regarded as an immediate A3SS 
expression of apperception, just as the supposed Cartesian inference cogito, 
ergo sumb is in fact tautological, since the cogito (sum cogitans/ immediately 
asserts the reality. But I am simple signifies no more than that 
this representation I encompasses not the least manifoldness within itself, 
and that it is an absolute (though merely logical) unity. 

Thus the so famous psychological proof is grounded merely on the 
indivisible unity of a representation, which governs the verb only in regard 
to a person. But it is obvious that the subject of inherence is designated 
only transcendentally through the I that is appended to 
thoughts, without noting the least property of it, or cognizing or knowing 
anything at all about it. It signifies only a Something in general (a 
transcendental subject), the representation of which must of course be 
simple, just because one determines nothing at all about it; for certainly 
nothing can be represented as more simple than that which is represented 
through the concept of a mere Something. But the simplicity of 
the representation of a subject is not therefore a cognition of the simplicity 
of the subject itself, since its properties are entirely abstracted 
from if it is designated merely through the expression "I," wholly empty 
of content (which I can apply to every thinking subject).

logical unity of the subject (simplicity), but I do not cognize the real 
simplicity of my subject. Just as the proposition "I am substance" signifies 
nothing but the pure category, of which I can make no (empirical) 
use in concreto, so is it permitted to me to say, "I am a simple substance," 
i.e., a substance the representation of which never contains a synthesis 
of the manifold; but this concept, or even this proposition, teaches us 
not the least bit in regard to myself as an object of experience, because 
the concept of substance is used only as a function of synthesis, without 
an intuition being subsumed under it, hence without an object; a and it 
is valid only of the condition of our cognition, but not of any particular 
object that is to be specified. We will perform an experiment concerning 
the supposed usefulness of this proposition. 

Everyone must admit that the assertion of the simple nature of the 
soul is of unique value only insofar as through it I distinguish this subject 
from all matter, and consequently except it from the perishability to 
which matter is always subjected.26 It is really only to this use that the 
above proposition is applied, hence it is often expressed thus: the soul is 

A357 not corporeal. Now ifI can show that even if one concedes all objective 
validity to this cardinal proposition of the rational doctrine of the soul 
(that everything which thinks is a simple substance) in its pure significance 
as a merely rational judgment (from pure categories), nevertheless 
not the least use of this proposition can be made in respect of its 
dissimilarity to or affinity with matter, then this would be the same as if 
I had consigned this supposed psychological insight to the field of mere 
ideas, which lack the reality of an objective use. 


In the transcendental aesthetic we have undeniably proved that bodies 
are mere appearances of our outer sense, and not things in themselves. 
In accord with this, we can rightfully say that our thinking 
subject is not corporeal, meaning that since it is represented as an object 
of our inner sense, insofar as it thinks it could not be an object of 
outer sense, i.e., it could not be an appearance in space. Now this is to 

say as much as that thinking beings, as such, can never come before us 
among outer appearances, or: we cannot intuit their thoughts, their 
consciousness, their desires, etc. externally; for all this belongs before 
inner sense. In fact this argument seems to be the natural and popular 

A358 one, by which even the commonest understanding seems always to have 
been pleased and thereby to have begun very early to consider souls as 
beings wholly distinct from their bodies. 
But now although extension, impenetrability, composition and motion 
-in short, everything our outer senses can transmit to us -areb not 
thoughts, feelings, inclinations or decisions, and cannot contain them,

420 



Chapter I. On the paralogisms of pure reason <A> 

as these are never objects of outer intuition, yet that same Something 
that grounds outer appearances and affects our sense so that it receives 
the representations of space, matter, shape, etc. -this Something, considered 
as noumenon (or better, as transcendental object) could also at 
the same time be the subject of thoughts, even though we receive no intuition 
of representations, volitions, etc. in the way we are affected 
through outer sense, but rather receive merely intuitions of space and 
its determinations. But this Something is not extended, not impenetrable, 
not composite, because these predicates pertain only to sensibility 
and its intuition, insofar as we are affected by such objects a (otherwise 
unknown to us). These expressions, however, do not give us cognition 
of what kind of object it is, but only that, since it is considered in itself 
without relation to outer sense, it is such that these predicates of outer 
appearances cannot be applied to it. Yet the predicates of inner sense, A359 
representation and thought, do not contradict it. Accordingly, even 
through the conceded simplicity of its nature the human soul is not at 
all sufficiently distinguished from matter in regard to its substratum, if 
one considers matter (as one should) merely as appearance. 

If matter were a thing in itself, then as a composite being it would be 
completely distinguished from the soul as a simple being. But it is 
merely an outer appearance, whose substratum is not cognized through 
any specifiable predicates; hence I can well assume about this substratum 
that in itself it is simple, even though in the way it affects our outer 
senses it produces in us the intuition of something extended and hence 
composite; and thus I can also assume that in the substance in itself, to 
which extension pertains in respect of our outer sense, thoughts may 
also be present, which may be represented with consciousness through 
their own inner sense. In such a way the very same thing that is called 
a body in one relation would at the same time be a thinking being in another, 
whose thoughts, of course, we could not intuit, but only their 
signs in appearance. Thereby the expression that only souls (as a particular 
species of substances) think would be dropped; and instead it 
would be said, as usual, that human beings think, i.e., that the same A360 
being that as outer appearance is extended is inwardly (in itself) a subject, 
which is not composite, but is simple and thinks. 

But without allowing such hypotheses, one can remark generally that 
if by a "soul" I understand a thinking being in itself, then it is already in 
itself an unsuitable question to ask whether or not it is of the same 
species as matter (which is not a thing in itself at all, but only a species 
of representations in us); for it is already self-evident that a thing in itself 
is of another nature than the determinations that merely constitute 
its state. 

a Objecte

But if we compare the thinking I not with matter but with the intelligible 
that grounds the outer appearance we call matter, than because 
we know nothing at all about the latter, we cannot say that the soul is 
inwardly distinguished from it in any way at all. 

Accordingly, the simplicity of consciousness a is thus no acquaintance 
with the simple nature of our subject, insofar as this subject is supposed 
thereby to be distinguished from matter as a composite being. 

Ifthis concept still does not serve to determine itb what is proper and 

distinctive to its nature even in the one case where it is useful, namely 

in the comparison of my self with objects of outer experience, one may 

A361 still pretend to know that the thinking I,the soul (a name for the transcendental 
object of inner sense), is simple; nevertheless on this account 
this expression has no use at all that reaches to real objects, and hence 
it cannot extend our cognition in the least. 
Accordingly, the whole of rational psychology collapses along with its 
chief supports, and here as elsewhere we can have little hope of broadening 
our insight through mere concepts without any relation to possible 
experience (still less through the mere subjective form of all our 
concepts, our consciousness); above all, since even the fundamental 
concept of a simple nature is of such a kind as cannot be encountered 
anywhere in experience, and hence there is thus no path at all by which 
to reach it as an objectively valid concept.

If I want to cognize through experience the numerical identity of an

to which, as subject, everything else relates as a determination, and I 
will notice the identity of the former in the time in which the latter 
changes. But now I am an object of inner sense and all time is merely 
the form of inner sense. Consequently, I relate each and every one of

my successive determinations to the numerically identical Self in all 
time, i.e., in the form of the inner intuition of my self. On this basis the 
personality of the soul must be regarded not as inferred but rather as a 
completely identical proposition of self-consciousness in time, and that 
is also the cause of its being valid a priori. For it really says no more than 
that in the whole time in which I am conscious of myself, I am conscious 
of this time as belonging to the unity of my Self, and it is all the 
same whether I say that this whole time is in Me, as an individual unity, 
or that I am to be found with numerical identity, in all of this time. 

The identity of person is therefore inevitably to be encountered in 
my own consciousness. But if I consider myself from the standpoint of 
another (as an object of his outer intuition), then it is this external observer 
who originally considersa me as in time; for in apperception 
time is properly represented only in me. Thus from the I that accompanies 
-and indeed with complete identity -all representations at every A363 
time in my consciousness, although he admits this I, he will still not 
infer the objective persistence of my Self. For just as the time in which 
the observer posits me is not the time that is encountered in my sensibility 
but that which is encountered in his own, so the identity that is 
necessarily combined with my consciousness is not therefore combined 
with his consciousness, i.e., with the outer intuition of my subject. 

The identity of the consciousness of Myself in different times is therefore 
only a formal condition of my thoughts and their connection, but it 
does not prove at all the numerical identity of my subject, in which -despite 
the logical identity of the I -a change can go on that does not allow 
it to keep its identity; and this even though all the while the identicalsounding 
"I" is assigned to it, which in every other state, even in the replacement 
of the subject, still keeps in view the thought of the previous 
subject, and thus could also pass it along to the following one.* 

* An elastic ball that strikes another one in a straight line communicates to the 
latter its whole motion, hence its whole state (if one looks only at their positions 
in space). Now assuming substances, on the analogy with such bodies, in 
which representations, together with consciousness of them, flow from one to A364 
another, a whole series of these substances may be thought, of which the first 
would communicate its state, together with its consciousness, to the second, 
which would communicate its own state, together with that of the previous 
substance, to a third substance, and this in turn would share the states of all 
previous ones, together with their consciousness and its own. The last substance 
would thus be conscious of all the states of all the previously altered 
substances as its own states, because these states would have been carried over 
to it, together with the consciousness of them; and in spite of this it would not 
have been the very same person in all these states.28

A 364 Even if the saying of some ancient schools, that everything is transitory 
and nothing in the world is persisting and abiding/9 cannot hold 
as soon as one assumes substances, it is still not refuted through the 
unity of self-consciousness. For we cannot judge even from our own 
consciousness whether as soul we are persisting or not, because we ascribe 
to our identical Self only that of which we are conscious; and so 
we must necessarily judge that we are the very same in the whole of the 
time of which we are conscious. But from the standpoint of someone 
else we cannot declare this to be valid because, since in the soul we encounter 
no persisting appearance other than the representation "I," 
which accompanies and connects all of them, we can never make out 
whether this I (a mere thought) does not flow as well as all the other 
thoughts that are linked to one another through it. 

A36S It is remarkable, however, that personality, and its presupposition, 
persistence, hence the substantiality of the soul, must be proved only 
now for the first time. For if we could presuppose these, then what 
would of course follow is not the continuous duration of consciousness, 
but rather the possibility of a continuing consciousness in an abiding 
subject, which is already sufficient for personality, since that does not 
cease at once just because its effect is perhaps interrupted for a time. 
This persistence, however, is not given to us through anything prior to 
the numerical identity of our Self, which we conclude from identical 
apperception, but rather is concluded for the first time from it (and, if 
things went rightly, we would have to conclude from this first of all the 
concept of substance, which is usable only empirically). Now since this 
identity of person in no way follows from the identity of the I in the 
consciousness of all the time in which I cognize myself, even the substantiality 
of the soul cannot be grounded on it above. 
Meanwhile, the concept of personality, just like the concepts of substance 
and of the simple, can remain (insofar as it is merely transcendental, 
i.e., a unity of the subject which is otherwise unknown to us, but 
in whose determinations there is a thoroughgoing connection of apperception), 
and to this extent this concept is also necessary and sufficient 

A 366 for practical use; but we can never boast of it as an extension of our selfknowledgea 
through pure reason, which dazzles us with the uninterrupted 
continuous duration of the subject drawn from the mere concept 
of the identical self, since this concept merely revolves in a circle 
around itself and brings us no farther in regard to even one single question 
about synthetic cognition. VVhat matter is, as a thing in itself (transcendental 
object)r,b is of course entirely unknown to us; nevertheless its 
persistence will be observed as appearance as long as it is represented to

us as something external. But since I want to observe the mere I 
through the change in all my representations, I have once again no correlate 
other than Myself for my comparisons with the general conditions 
of my consciousness; I can therefore give nothing but tautological 
answers to all questions, because I substitute my concept and its unity 
for the properties pertaining to my self as an object,a and thus merely 
presuppose what one demanded to know. 


The fourth paralogism 
of the ideality 

(of outer relation).b 

That whose existence can be inferred only as a cause of given perceptions 
has only a doubtful existence: 

Now all outer appearances are of this kind: their existence cannot be A 367 
immediately perceived, but can be inferred only as the cause of given 
perceptions: 

Thus the existence of all objects of outer sense is doubtful. This uncertainty 
I call the ideality of outer appearances, and the doctrine of this 
ideality is called idealism, in comparison with which the assertion of a 
possible certainty of objects of outer sense is called dualism. 

Criticism of the fourth paralogism 
of transcendental psychology. 

First we will subject the premises to examination. We can rightly assert 
that only what is in ourselves can be immediately perceived, and that my 
own existence alone could be the object of a mere perception. Thus the 
existence of a real object outside me (if this last word is taken in an intellectual 
signification) is never given directly in perception, but can 
only be added in thought to what is a modification of inner sense as its 
external cause, and hence can only be inferred. Therefore Descartes also 
rightly limited all perception in the narrowest sense to the proposition 
"I (as a thinking being) am."30 Thus it is clear that since the external is A368 
not in me, I cannot encounter it in my apperception, hence not in any 
perception, which is properly only a determination of apperception. 

Thus I cannot really perceive external things, but only infer their existence 
from my inner perception, insofar as I regard this as the effect 
of which something external is the proximate cause. But now the inference 
from a given effect to its determinate cause is always uncertain, 
since the effect can have arisen from more than one cause. Accordingly, 

a Object 
b Verba/tnisses

in the relation of perception to its cause, it always remains doubtful 
whether this cause is internal or external, thus whether all so-called 
outer perceptions are not a mere play of our inner sense, or whether 
they are related to actual external objects as their cause. At least the existence 
of the latter is only inferred, and runs the risk of all inferences; 
by contrast, the object of inner sense (I myself with all my representations) 
is immediately perceived, and its existence suffers no doubt at all. 

Ey an idealist, therefore, one must understand not someone who denies 
the existence of external objects of sense, but rather someone who 
only does not admit that it is cognized through immediate perception 

A369 and infers from this that we can never be fully certain of their reality 
from any possible experience. 
Now before I display our paralogism in its deceptive illusion, I must 
first remark that one would necessarily have to distinguish a twofold 
idealism. I understand by the transcendental idealism of all appearances 
the doctrine a that they are all together to be regarded as mere 
representations and not as things in themselves, and accordingly that 
space and time are only sensible forms of our intuition, but not determinations 
given for themselves or conditions of objectsb as things in 
themselves. To this idealism is opposed transcendental realism, which 
regards space and time as something given in themselves (independent 
of our sensibility). The transcendental realist therefore represents outer 
appearances (if their reality is conceded) as things in themselves, which 
would exist independently of us and our sensibility and thus would also 
be outside us according to pure concepts of the understanding. It is really 
this transcendental realist who afterwards plays the empirical idealist; 
and after he has falsely presupposed about objects of the senses that 
if they are to exist they must have their existence in themselves even 
apart from sense, he finds that from this point of view all our representations 
of sense are insufficient to make their reality certain. 
The transcendental idealist, on the contrary, can be an empirical real-
ist, hence, as he is called, a dualist, i.e., he can concede the existence of 
matter without going beyond mere self-consciousness and assuming 
something more than the certainty of representations in me, hence the 
cogito, ergo sum.C For because he allows this matter and even its inner possibility 
to be valid only for appearance -which, separated from our sensibility, 
is nothing -matter for him is only a species of representations 
(intuition), which are called external, not as if they related to objects that 
are external in themselves but because they relate perceptions to space, 
where all things are external to one another, but that space itself is in us.

Chapter I. On the paralogisms of pure reason <A> 

Now we have already declared ourselves for this transcendental idealism 
from the outset. Thus our doctrinea removes all reservations 
about assuming the existence of matter based on the testimony of our 
mere self-consciousness, and it declares this to be proved in the same 
way as the existence of myself as a thinking being. For I am indeed conscious 
to myself of my representations; thus these exist, and I myself, 
who has these representations. But now external objects (bodies) are 
merely appearances, hence also nothing other than a species of my representations, 
whose objects are something only through these representations, 
but are nothing separated from them. Thus external things 
exist as well as my self, and indeed both exist on the immediate testi-A371 
mony of my self-consciousness, only with this difference: the representation 
of my Self, as the thinking subject, is related merely to inner 
sense, but the representations that designate extended beings are also 
related to outer sense. I am no more necessitated to draw inferences in 
respect of the reality of external objects than I am in regard to the reality 
of the objects of my inner sense (my thoughts), for in both cases they 
are nothing but representations, the immediate perception (consciousness) 
of which is at the same time a sufficient proof of their reality. 

Thus the transcendental idealist is an empirical realist, and grants to 
matter, as appearance, a reality which need not be inferred, but is immediately 
perceived. In contrast, transcendental realism necessarily falls 
into embarrassment, and finds itself required to give way to empirical 
idealism, because it regards the objects of outer sense as something different 
from the senses themselves and regards mere appearances as selfsufficient 
beings that are found external to us; for here, even with our 
best consciousness of our representation of these things, it is obviously 
far from certain that if the representation exists, then the object corresponding 
to it would also exist; but in our system, on the contrary, these 
external things -namely, matter in all its forms and alterations -are 
nothing but mere representations, i.e., representations in us, of whose A 3 72 
reality we are immediately conscious. 


Now since as far as I know all those psychologists who cling to empirical 
idealism are transcendental realists, they have obviously proceeded 
very consistently in conceding great importance to empirical 
idealism as one of the problems from which human reason knows how 
to extricate itself only with difficulty. For in fact if one regards outer appearances 
as representations that are effected in us by their objects, as 
things in themselves found outside us, then it is hard to see how their existence 
could be cognized in any way other than by an inference from effect 
to cause, in which case it must always remain doubtful whether the 
cause is in us or outside us. Now one can indeed admit that something 

a Lehrbegriff 


427 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. Bk. II <A> 

that may be outside us in the transcendental sense is the cause of our 
outer intuitions, but this is not the object we understand by the representation 
of matter and corporeal things; for these are merely appearances, 
i.e., mere modes of representation, which are always found only 
in us, and their reality, just as much as that of my own thoughts, rests on 
immediate consciousness. The transcendental object is equally unknown 

A373 in regard to inner and to outer sense. But we are talking not about that, 
but about the empirical object, which is called an external object if it is 
in space and an inner object if it is represented simply in the relationa 
of time; but space and time are both to be encountered only in us. 
But since the expression outside us carries with it an unavoidable 
ambiguity, since it sometimes signifies something that, as a thing in itself, 
exists distinct from us and sometimes merely something that belongs 
to outer appearance, then in order to escape uncertainty and use 
this concept in the latter significance -in which it is taken in the proper 
psychological question about the reality of our outer intuition -we will 
distinguish empirically external objects from those that might be 
called "external" in the transcendental sense, by directly calling them 
"things that are to be encountered in space."3I 
Space and time are of course representations a priori, which dwell in 


A374 
us as forms of our sensible intuition before any real object has even determined 
our inner sense through sensation in such a way that we represent 
it under those sensible relations.b This material or real entity, 
however, this Something that is to be intuited in space, necessarily presupposes 
perception, and it cannot be invented by any power of imagination 
or produced independently of perception, which indicates the 
reality of something in space. Thus sensation is that which designates a 
reality in space and time, according to whether it is related to the one or 
the other mode of sensible intuition. Once sensation is given (which, if 
it is applied to an object in general without determining it, is called perception), 
then through its manifold many an object can be invented C in 
imagination that has no empirical place outside imagination in space or 
time. Whether we take sensations, pleasure and pain, or even external 
sensations, such as colors, warmth, etc., it is certain beyond doubt that 
it is perception through which the material must first be given for thinking 
objects of sensible intuition. This perception thus represents (staying 
for now only with outer intuitions) something real in space. For 
first, perception is the representation of a reality, just as space is the representation 
of a mere possibility of coexistence.d Second, this reality is 

a Verhiiltnis 
b Verhiiltnisse 
, gedichtet 
d Beisammenseins 

428 


Chapter I. On the paralogisms of pure reason <A> 

represented before outer sense, i.e., in space. Third, space is nothing 
other than a mere representation, hence only what is represented* in it 
can count as real, and conversely, what is given in it, i.e., represented A375 
through perception, is also real in it; for if it were not real in space, i.e., 
immediately given through empirical intuition, then it could not also be 
invented,a because one cannot just think up the real in intuition a priori.b 

Every outer perception therefore immediately proves something real 
in space, or rather is itself the real; to that extent, empirical realism is 
beyond doubt, i.e., to our outer intuitions there corresponds something 
real in space. Of course space itself with all its appearances, as representations, 
is only in me; but in this space the real, or the material of all 
objects of outer intuition is nevertheless really given, independently of 
all invention; and it is also impossible that in this space anything outside 
us (in the transcendental sense) should be given, since space itself 
is nothing apart from our sensibility. Thus the strictest C idealist cannot 
demand that one prove that the object outside us (in the strictd sense) A376 
corresponds to our perception. For if there were such a thing, then it 
still could not be represented and intuited outside us, because this 
would presuppose space; and reality in space, as a mere representation, 
is nothing other than perception itself. The real in outer appearances is 
thus actual only in perception, and cannot be actual in any other way. 

Now cognition of objects can be generated from perceptions, either 
through a mere play of imagination or by means of experience. And 
then of course there can arise deceptive representations, to which objects 
do not correspond, and where the deception is sometimes to be attributed 
to a semblance of the imagination (in dreams), sometimes to a 
false step of judgment (in the case of so-called sense-deceptions). In 
order to avoid the false illusion here, one proceeds according to the 

* One must note well this paradoxical but correct proposition, that nothing is A 374 
in space except what is represented in it. For space itself is nothing other than 
representation; consequently, what is in it must be contained in representa-A 375 
tion, and nothing at all is in space except insofar as it is really represented in 
it. A proposition which must of course sound peculiar is that a thing can exist 
only in the representation of it; but it loses its offensive character here, because 
the things with which we have to do are not things in themselves but 
only appearances, i.e., representations.

rule: Whatever is connected with a perception according to empiricalslaws, 
is actualY Only this deception, as much as the measures 
taken against it, concerns idealism as much as dualism, since here it is 
only a question of the form of experience. In order to refute empirical 
idealism, as a false scruple concerning the objective reality of our outer 

perceptions, it is already sufficient that outer perception immediately 

A 3 77 proves a reality in space, which space, though in itself it is only a mere 
form of representations, nevertheless has objective reality in regard to 
all outer appearances (which are also nothing but mere representations); 
and it is likewise sufficient to refute empirical idealism that without 
perception even fictions and dreams are not possible, so our outer 
senses, as regards the data from which experience can arise, have actual 
corresponding objects in space. 
The dogmatic idealist would be one who denies the existence of 
matter, the skeptical idealist one who doubts them because he holds 
them to be unprovable.33 The former can be so only because he believes 
he can find contradictions in the possibility of a matter in general, and 
just now we are not yet dealing with that. The following section on dialectical 
inferences, which represents reason in its internal conflict regarding 
the concepts belonging to the possibility of the connection of 
experience, will also help us out of this difficulty.34 The skeptical idealist, 
however, who impugns merely the grounds of our assertion of the 
existence of matter and declares insufficient our persuasion of it, which 
is grounded on immediate perception, is a benefactor to human reason, 
since he requires us to open our eyes well even in the smallest steps of 


A 3 78 common experience, and not immediately to take for a well-earned possession 
what we perhaps obtain only surreptitiously. The utility created 
by these idealistic projects is now clearly before our eyes. They drive us 
forcefully -if we do not want to become tangled in confusions in our 
commonest assertions -to regard all perceptions, whether they are 
called inner or outer, merely as a consciousness of something that depends 
on our sensibility, and to regard their external objects not as 
things in themselves but only as representations, of which we can become 
immediately conscious like any other representation, but which 
are called external because they depend on that sense which we call 
outer sense; its intuition is space, but it is itself nothing other than an 
inner mode of representation, in which certain perceptions are connected 
with one another. 
If we let outer objects count as things in themselves, then it is absolutely 
impossible to comprehend how we are to acquire cognition of 
their reality outside us, since we base this merely on the representation, 
which is in us. For one cannot have sensation outside oneself, but only 
in oneself, and the whole of self-consciousness therefore provides nothing 
other than merely our own determinations. Skeptical idealism thus 

430 



Chapter I. On the paralogisms of pure reason <A> 

requires us to take the only refuge remaining to us, namely to grasp the 
ideality of all appearances, which we have already established in the 
Transcendental Aesthetic independently of these consequences, which 
we could not then have foreseen. Now if one asks whether dualism A379 
alone holds in the doctrine of the soul, then the answer is: Of course, 
but only in the empirical sense, i.e., in the connection of experience 
matter as substance in appearance is really given to outer sense, just as 
the thinking I is given to inner sense, likewise as substance in appearance; 
and in the connection of our outer as well as our inner perceptions, 
appearances on both sides must be connected among themselves 
into one experience according to the rules that the category of substance 
brings in. But if one wants to broaden the concept of dualism as 
it is usually applied and take it in a transcendental sense, then neither it, 
nor the pneumatism that is opposed to it on the one side, nor the materialism 
on the other side, have the least ground, since then one's concepts 
would lack determination, and one would take the difference in 
the mode of representing objects, which are unknown to us as to what 
they are in themselves, for a difference in these things themselves. I, 
represented through inner sense in time, and objects in space outside 
me, are indeed specifically a wholly distinct appearances, but they are 
not thereby thought of as different things. The transcendental objectb 
that grounds both outer appearances and inner intuition is neither mat-A380 
ter nor a thinking being in itself, but rather an unknown ground of 
those appearances that supply us with our empirical concepts of the former 
as well as the latter. 


If, therefore, as the present critique obviously requires of us, we remain 
true to the rule established earlier not to press our questions beyond 
that with which possible experience and its objectC can supply us, 
then it will not occur to us to seek information about what the objects 
of our senses may be in themselves, i.e., apart from any relation to the 
senses. But if a psychologist takes appearances for things in themselves, 
then as a materialist he may take up matter into his doctrine, or as a 
spiritualist he may take up merely thinking beings (namely, according 
to the form of our inner sense) as the single and sole thing existing in 
itself, or as a dualist he may take up both; yet through misunderstanding 
he will always be confined to sophistical reasonings about the way 
in which that which is no thing in itself, but only the appearance of a 
thing in general, might exist in itself.

A38r Observation a on 
the sum of the pure doctrine of the soul, 
following these paralogisms. 


If we compare the doctrine of the soul, as the physiology of inner 
sense, with the doctrine of bodies, as a physiology of the objects of 
outer sense, then we will find that aside from the fact that in both doctrines 
much can be cognized empirically, there is nevertheless this remarkable 
difference, that in the latter science much can be cognized a 
priori from the mere concept of an extended impenetrable being, but in 
the former science nothing at all can be cognized a priori from the concept 
of a thinking being. The cause is this: Although both are appearances, 
the appearance before outer sense has something standing and 
abiding in it, which supplies a substratum grounding the transitory determinations, 
and thus also a synthetic concept, namely that of space 
and of an appearance in it; whereas time, which is the only form of our 
inner intuition, has in it nothing abiding, and hence gives cognition only 
of a change of determinations, but not of the determinable object. For 
in that which we call the soul, everything is in continual flux, and it has 
nothing abiding, except perhaps (if one insists)b the I, which is simple 
only because this representation has no content, and hence no manifold, 
on account of which it seems to represent a simple object,c or better put, 
it seems to designate one. This I would have to be an intuition, which, 
since it would be presupposed in all thinking in general (prior to all experience), 
would, as an intuition, supply a priori synthetic propositions 
if it were to be possible to bring about a pure rational cognition of the 
nature of a thinking being in general. Yet this I is no more an intuition 
than it is a concept of any object; rather, it is the mere form of consciousness,
d which accompanies both sorts of representations and which 
can elevate them to cognitions only insofar as something else is given in 
intuition, which provides the material for the representation of an object. 
Thus the whole of rational psychology, as a science transcending all 
the powers of human reason, collapses, and nothing is left except to

study our soul following the guidelinea of experience, and to remain 
within the limit of those questions that do not go beyond that whose 
content can be provided by possible inner experience. 

But if it has no utility as an extension of our cognition, but so regarded 
is rather composed of mere paralogisms, it still cannot be denied 
an important negative utility even if it is to count for nothing more than 
a critical treatment of our dialectical inferences, those of common and 
natural reason. 

Why do we have need of a doctrine of the soul grounded merely on A3 8 3 
pure rational principles?b Without doubt chiefly with the intent of securing 
our thinking Self from the danger of materialism. But this is 
achieved by the rational concept of our thinking Self that we have 
given. For according to it, so little fear remains that if one took matter 
away then all thinking and even the existence of thinking beings would 
be abolished, that it rather shows clearly that if I were to take away the 
thinking subject, the whole corporeal world would have to disappear, as 
this is nothing but the appearance in the sensibility of our subject and 
one mode of its representations. 


Thereby of course I obviously cognize this thinking Self no better as 
to its properties, nor can I have any insight into its persistence, or even 
the independence of its existence from whatever transcendental substratum 
of outer appearances there may be, for this is just as unknown 
to me as the self is. But since it is likewise possible that I may find cause, 
drawn from somewhere else than mere speculative grounds, to hope for 
an existence of my thinking nature that is self-sufficient and persisting 
through all possible changes of my state, much is still won if, through 
the free confession of my ignorance, I can nevertheless repel the dogmatic 
attacks of a speculative opponent, and show him that he can never A384 
know more in which to deny my expectations about the nature of my 
subject than I can in order to hold to them. 

On this transcendental illusion of our psychological concepts, then, 
three dialectical questions are grounded, which constitute the proper 
goal of rational psychology, and cannot be decided otherwise than by 
the above investigations. These questions are, namely: J) about the possibility 
of the community of the soul with an organic body, i.e., the animality 
and the state of the soul in the life of the human being; 2) about 
the beginning of this community, i.e., of the soul in and before the birth 
of the human being; and 3) as to the end of this community, i.e., of the 
soul in and after the death of the human being (the question concerning 
immortality).

Now I assert that all the difficulties one believes he finds in these questions, 
and with which, as dogmatic objections, one seeks to give the appearance 
of having a deeper insight into the nature of things than the 
common understanding can have, rest on a mere semblance, according 
to which one hypostatizes what exists merely in thoughts, and -assuming 
it to be a real object outside the thinking subject -takes the same 
quality, namely extension, which is nothing but appearance, for a property 
of external things subsisting even apart from our sensibility, and 

A385 takes motion for its effect, which really takes place in itself outside our 
senses. For matter, whose community with the soul excites such great 
reservations, is nothing other than a mere form, or a certain mode of representation 
of an unknown object, through that intuition that one calls 
outer sense. Thus there may very well be something outside us, which we 
call matter, corresponding to this appearance; but in the same quality as 
appearance it is not outside us, but is merely as a thought in us, even 
though this thought, through the sense just named, represents it as being 
found outside us. Matter thus signifies not a species of substances quite 
different and heterogeneous from the object of inner sense (the soul), but 
rather only the heterogeneity of the appearances of substances (which in 
themselves are unknown to us), whose representations we call external in 
comparison with those that we ascribe to inner sense, even though they 
belong as much to the thinking subject as other thoughts do; only they 
have in themselves this deceptive feature, that since they represent objects 
in space, they seem to cut themselves loose from the soul, as it were, 
and hover outside it; although space itself, in which they are intuited, is 
nothing but a representation, whose counterpart in the same quality outside 
the soul cannot be encountered at all. Now the question is no longer 

A386 about the community of the soul with other known but different substances 
outside us, but merely about the conjunction of representations 
in inner sense with the modifications of our outer sensibility, and how 
these may be conjoined with one another according to constant laws, so 
that they are connected into one experience.35 
As long as we keep inner and outer appearances together with one 
another, as mere representations in experience, we find nothing absurd 
and nothing that makes the community of both modes of sense appear 
strange. But as soon as we hypostatize outer appearances, no longer relating 
them to our thinking subject as representations but rather relating 
them to it in the same quality as they are in us as things external 
to us and subsisting by themselves, and relating their actions, which 
show themselves as appearances in relationa to one another, to our 
thinking subject, then we have a characteristic of the efficient causes

outside us that is not coherent with their effects in us, because the character 
of the cause relates merely to outer sense, while the effects relate 
to inner sense; which senses, although united in one subject, are nevertheless 
most unlike each other. There we have no other external effects 
except alterations of place, and no powers except efforts that result in 
relations a in space as their effects. But in us the effects are thoughts, 
among which no relationsb of place, motion, shape or spatial determi-A387 
nation occur, and we wholly lose the guidance of causes in the effects 
which they are to exhibit in inner sense. But we should consider that 
bodies are not objects in themselves that are present to us, but rather a 
mere appearance of who knows what unknown object; that motion is 
not the effect of this unknown cause, but merely the appearance of its 
influence on our senses; that consequently neither of these is something 
outside us, but both are merely representations in us, hence that it is not 
the motion of matter that causes representations in us, but that motion 
itself (hence also the matter that makes itself knowable through it) is a 
mere representation; and finally that the whole self-made difficulty 
comes to this: How and through what cause do the representations of 
our sensibility stand in combination with one another, so that those 
representations that we call outer intuitions can be represented according 
to empirical laws as objects outside us? -a question that does not in 
tlle least contain the supposed difficulty of explaining the origin of representations 
by entirely different sorts of efficient causes found outside 
us, as when we take the appearance of an unknown cause for the cause 
outside us, which can occasion nothing but confusion. In judgments in 
which a misinterpretation is deeply rooted through long habit, it is impossible 
to correct them immediately with that lucidity that can be fur-A 388 
thered in other cases, where our concept is not confused by such an 
unavoidable illusion. Hence our liberation of reason from sophistical 
theories can hardly have the clarity necessary for complete satisfaction. 

I believe I can further it in the following way. 

All objections can be divided into dogmatic, critical and skeptical 
ones. A dogmatic objection is one that is directed against a proposition, 
but a critical one is directed against its proof. The former requires an 
insight into the constitution of the nature of the object, in order to be 
able to assert the opposite of what the proposition claims about the object; 
it is itself dogmatic, therefore, and claims to have better acquaintance 
with the constitution of the object being talked about than its 
opposite has. The critical objection, because it leaves the proposition 
untouched in its worth or worthlessness, and impugns only the proof, 


a Verhiiltnisse 
b Verhiiltnisse 


435 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II <A> 

does not at all need to have better acquaintance with the object or to 
pretend to better acquaintance with it; it shows only that the assertion 
is groundless, not that it is incorrect. The skeptical objection puts the 
proposition and its opposite over against one another, as objections of 
equal weight, each alternatively a dogma with the other as an objection 

A 389 to it; thus on both opposed sides it is dogmatic in appearance,a in order 
to annihilate entirely every judgment about the object. Thus both, the 
dogmatic as well as the skeptical objection, must claim as much insight 
into its object as is necessary to assert something about it either affirmatively 
or negatively. The critical objection alone is of such a kind that 
it overturns a theory merely by showing that one assumes on behalf of 
its assertion something that is nugatory and merely imagined, thereby 
withdrawing from it the presumed foundation without otherwise wanting 
to decide anything about the constitution of the object. 
Now according to the common concepts of our reason in regard to 
the community in which our thinking subject stands to things outside 
us we are dogmatic, and regard these things as objects truly subsisting 
independently of us, according to a certain transcendental dualism that 
does not count those outer appearances as representations of the subject 
but rather displaces them, as the sensible intuition that provides 
them to us, outside us as objects,b separating them entirely from the 
thinking subject. Now this subreption is the foundation of all theories 
about the community between soul and body, and it is never asked 
whether this objective reality of appearances is completely correct, but 
rather this is taken for granted, and the sophistry is only about the way 

A 390 this is to be explained and comprehended. The three usual systems that 
have been thought up about this, really the only possible ones, are those 
of physical influence, of preestablished harmony, and of supernatural 
assistance.36 
The last two ways of explaining the community of the soul with matter 
are grounded on objections to the first, which is the conception c of 
the common understanding; they object, namely, that what appears as 
matter could not, through its immediate influence, be the cause of representations, 
since these are an entirely heterogeneous species of effects. 
However, they cannot combine what they understand as the object of 
outer sense with the concept of matter, which is nothing but an appearance, 
thus in itself a mere representation caused by some external object 
or other, for then they would be saying that the representations of external 
objects (appearances) could not be external causes of representations 
in our mind; that would be a wholly senseless objection, because it 

ardem Scheine nach 
b Objecte 
C Vorstellung 


436 



Chapter I. On the paralogisms of pure reason <A> 

would never occur to anyone to take as an external cause what he has already 
recognized as a mere representation. According to our principles 
they would therefore have to direct their theory at this: that what is the 
true (transcendental) object of our outer sense could not be the cause of 
those representations (appearances) that we understand under the name 
of matter. Now since no one can claim with good ground to be ac-A39I 
quainted with anything of the transcendental cause of our representations 
of outer sense, any assertion about it is entirely groundless. But if 
the supposed improvers of the doctrine of physical influence, in accordance 
with the common way of representing a transcendental dualism, 
want to regard matter as such as a thing in itself (and not as the mere appearance 
of an unknown thing), and to direct their objection to showing 
that such an external object, which exhibits in itself no other causality 
than that of motion, could never be the efficient cause of representations, 
but rather that a third being must mediate between them in order 
to establish, if not reciprocity, then at least correspondence and harmony, 
then in that case they would have to begin their refutation by assuming 
in their dualism the JtQwtQv 1jJ£u60s;o of physical influence, and 
thus their objection would refute not so much the natural influence as 
their own dualistic presupposition. For all the difficulties that concern 
the combination of thinking nature with matter arise without exception 
solely from the surreptitious dualistic notionb that matter as such is not 
an appearance, i.e., a mere representation of the mind, which corresponds 
to an unknown object, but is rather ::In object in itself, as it exists 
outside us and independently of all sensibility. 

Thus no dogmatic objection can be made against the physical influ-A392 
ence that is commonly assumed. For if the opponent assumes that matter 
and its motion are mere appearances and thus themselves only 
representations, then he can place the difficulty only in the fact that the 
unknown object of our sensibility could not be the cause of representations 
in us; a claim, however, for which he has not the least justification, 
because no one can decide about an unknown object what it can or cannot 
do. But according to our proof above, he must necessarily admit this 
transcendental idealism, unless he wants to hypostatize what are obviously 
representations and displace them outside himself, as true things. 

Nonetheless, a well-grounded critical objection can be made against 
the common doctrinal opinionc of physical influence. The sort of community 
that is claimed to occur between two species of substances, 
thinking and extended, is grounded on a crude dualism, and makes the 
latter substances, which are nothing but mere representations of the 

a primary falsity 
b Vorstellung 
, Lehrmeinung 


437 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II <A> 

thinking subject, into things subsisting for themselves. Thus the misunderstood 
physical influence can be completely thwarted by revealing 
the argument for it to be nugatory and surreptitious. 

Thus if one separates out everything imaginary, the notorious question 
about the community between what thinks and what is extended 

4. 393 would merely come to this: How is outer intuition -namely, that of 
space (the filling of it by shape and motion) -possible at all in a thinking 
subject? But it is not possible for any human being to find an answer 
to this question, and no one will ever fill this gap in our knowledge, 
but rather only indicate it, by ascribing outer appearances to a transcendental 
object that is the cause of this species of representations, with 
which cause, however, we have no acquaintance at all, nor will we ever 
get a concept of it. In all the tasks that may come before us in the field 
ofexperience, we treat those appearances as objects in themselves, without 
worrying ourselves about the primary ground of their possibility (as 
appearances). But if we go beyond their boundary, then the concept of 
a transcendental object becomes necessary. 
An immediate consequence of these considerationsa concerning the 
community between thinking and extended beings is the decision of all 
disputes or objections concerning the state of the thinking nature prior 
to this community (to life) or after such a community is terminated (in 
death). The opinion that the thinking subject could have thought prior 
to all community with bodies would be expressed this way: that bef0fe 
the beginning of the kind of sensibility through which something ap-

Ar394 pears to us in space, the same transcendental objects that appear as bodies 
in the present state could have been intuited in a wholly different 
way. But the opinion that the soul could still continue to think after all 
community with the corporeal world has been terminated would be expressed 
in this form: that if the mode of sensibility through which transcendental 
(and for now entirely unknown) objects appear as a material 
world should cease, then not all intuition would thereby be terminated, 
and it might well be possible for the very same unknown object to continue 
to be cognized by the thinking subject, even though obviously not 
in the quality of bodies. 

Now of course no one can adduce the least ground for such an assertion 
from speculative principles ,b nor even indeed establish its possibility, 
but rather it can only be presupposed; yet just as little can anyone 
make any valid dogmatic objection against it. For whoever he may be, 
he knows just as little as I or anyone else about the absolute and inner 
cause of external and corporeal appearances. Therefore he cannot claim 
to know what the reality of outer appearances rests on in the present 


a Erinnerungen 
b Principien 


43r8 



Chapter 1. On the paralogisms of pure reason <A> 

state (in life), hence he also cannot claim to know that the condition of 
all outer intuition, or even of the thinking subject itself, will cease after A 395 
this state (after death). 

Thus every dispute about the nature of our thinking being and its 
conjunction with the corporeal world is merely a consequence of the 
fact that one fills the gaps regarding what one does not know with paralogisms 
of reason, making thoughts into things and hypostatizing 
them; from this arises an imagined science, both in regard to affirmative 
and negative assertions, in that everyone either presumes to know 
something about objects about which no human being has any concept, 
or else makes his own representations into objects, and thus goes round 
and round in an eternal circle of ambiguities and contradictions. 
Nothing but the sobriety of a strict but just criticism can liberate us 
from these dogmatic semblances, which through imagined happiness 
hold so many subject to theories and systems, and limit all our speculative 
claims merely to the field of possible experience, not by stale mockery 
at attempts that have so often failed, or by pious sighing over the 
limits of our reason, but by means of a complete determination of reason's 
boundaries according to secure principles, which with the greatest 
reliability fastens its nihil ulteriusa on those Pillars of Hercules37 that 
nature has erected, so that the voyage of our reason may proceed only 
as far as the continuous coastline of experience reaches, a coastline that A 396 
we cannot leave without venturing out into a shoreless ocean, which, 
among always deceptive prospects, forces us in the end to abandon as 
hopeless all our troublesome and tedious efforts.

We still owe a distinct and general exposition of the transcendental 
and yet natural illusion in the paralogisms of pure reason, and also of a 
justification of their systematic ordering, running parallel to the table of 
categories. We could not have undertaken it at the beginning of this 
section without the danger of falling into obscurity or clumsily getting 
ahead of ourselves. Now we want to try to fulfill this obligation. 

One can place all illusion in the taking of a subjective condition of 
thinking for the cognition of an object.b In the Introduction to the 
Transcendental Dialectic we have further shown that pure reason concerns 
itself solely with totality in the synthesis of conditions for a given 
conditioned. Since now the dialectical illusion of pure reason cannot be 
any empirical illusion occurring along with determinate empirical cognitions, 
it must have to do with the universal conditions of thinking; 
and there are only three cases of the dialectical use of pure reason: A397

1. The synthesis of the conditions of a thought in general. 
2. The synthesis of the conditions of empirical thinking. 
3. The synthesis of the conditions of pure thinking. 
In all three of these cases pure reason is concerned merely with the 
absolute totality of this synthesis, i.e., with that condition that is itself 
unconditioned. On this division is grounded the threefold transcendental 
illusion, which occasions the three sections of the Dialectic, and provides 
us with the idea for an equal number of putative sciences of pure 
reason: transcendental psychology, cosmology and theology. Here we 
have to do only with the first. 

Because in thinking in general we abstract from every relation of the 
thought to any objecta (whether of sense or of the pure understanding), 
the synthesis of conditions of a thought in general (No. I) is not objective 
at all, but merely a synthesis of thought with the subject, which is, 
however, falsely taken to be a synthetic representation of an object.b 

But it follows from this that the dialectical inference to the conditions 
of every thought in general, which is itself unconditioned, does not 
commit a mistake in content (for it abstracts from all content or ob


A398 jects),c but rather that it is mistaken in form alone, and would have to 
be called a paralogism. 
Because, further, the only condition accompanying all thinking is the 
I, in the universal proposition "I think," reason has to do with this condition 
insofar as it is itself unconditioned. But it is only the formal condition, 
namely the logical unity of every thought, in which I abstract 
from every object; and yet it is represented as an object that I think, 
namely I itself, and its unconditioned unity. 

If anyone were to pose the question to me: What is the constitutiond 
of a thing that thinks? then I do not know the least thing to answer a 
priori, because the answer ought to be synthetic (for an analytic answer 
perhaps explains thinking, but gives no extended cognition of that on 
which thinking rests as to its possibility).' But for every synthetic solution, 
intuition is necessary; but this is entirely left out of so universal a 
problem. Likewise, no one can give a general answer to the question: 
Ofwhat kind must a thing be in order to be movable? For then impenetrable 
extension (matter) is not given. But now although I know no 
general answer to that question, yet it seems to me that I could give it 
in the individual case, in the proposition that expresses self-conscious


a Objectb Object 
, Objecte 
d Beschaffenheit 

point. 


Chapter I. On the paralogisms of pure reason <A> 

ness: "I think." For this I is the primary subject, i.e., substance, it is sim-A399 
pIe, etc. But then these would have to be mere propositions of experience, 
which, in the absence of a universal rule expressing in general and 
a priori the conditions of the possibility of thinking, coulda nevertheless 
contain no such predicates (since these are not empirical). In this way, 
my insight (so plausible at the start) into the nature of a thinking being, 
and indeed judged from mere concepts, becomes suspicious, even 
though I still have not discovered any mistake in it. 

Further investigation, however, going back behind the origin of these 
attributes that I ascribe to Myself as a thinking being in general, can discover 
this error. They are nothing more than pure categories, through 
which I never think a determinate object, but rather only the unity of 
representations in order to determine their object. Without an intuition 
to ground it, the category alone cannot yield any concept of an object; 
for only through intuition is an object given, which is then thought in 
accordance with the category. If I declare a thing to be a substance in 
appearance, predicates of its intuition must be given to me previously, 
in which I distinguish the substratum (the thing itself) from that which 
merely depends on it. When I call a thing simple in appearance, then A400 
by that I understand that its intuition is of course a part of the appearance, 
but cannot itself be further divided, etc. But if something is cognized 
as simple only in the concept and not in appearance, then I really 
have no cognition of the object, but only of my concept, which I make 
of something in general that is not susceptible of any real intuition. I say 
only that I think something entirely simple, because I really do not 
know anything further to say about it than merely that it is something. 

Now mere apperception ("I") is substance in concept, simple in concept, 
etc., and thus all these psychological theorems are indisputably 
correct. Nevertheless, one by no means thereby cognizes anything 
about the soul that one really wants to know, for all these predicates are 
not valid of intuition at all, and therefore cannot have any consequences 
that could be applied to objects of experience; hence they are completelyempty. 
For that concept of substance does not teach me that the 
soul endures for itself, that it is not a part of outer intuitions that cannot 
be further divided and hence could not arise or perish through any 
natural alterations -pureh properties that could provide acquaintance 
with the soul in the connection of the experience, and disclosure concerning 
its origin and future state. Now if! say through mere category: A401 
"The soul is a simple substance," then it is clear that since the understanding's 
naked concept of substance contains nothing beyond the fact 

n 

Kant's verb is singular, but its subject appears to be plural, namely the relative pronoun 
referring to "propositions of experience." 

b tauter 


441 



Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II <A> 

that the thing is to be represented as a subject in itself without in turn 
being the predicate of another subject, nothing about its persistence 
follows, and the attribute of simplicity certainly cannot be added to this 
persistence; hence one is not in the least instructed about what the soul 
can encounter in the alterations in the world. If one would tell us that 
it is a simple part of matter, then from what experience teaches us 
about this, we could derive its persistence and, together with its simple 
nature, its immortality. But the concept of the 1, in the psychological 
principle ("1 think"), tells us not one word about this. 

But that the being that thinks in us supposes that it cognizes itself 
through pure categories, and indeed through those under each heading 
that express absolute unity, follows from this: Apperception is itself the 
ground of the possibility of the categories, which for their part represent 
nothing other than the synthesis of the manifold of intuition, insofar as 
that manifold has unity in apperception. Self-consciousness in general is 
therefore the representation of that which is the condition of all unity, 
and yet is itself unconditioned. Hence of the thinking 1 (the soul), which 

A402 [thus represents] itself as substance, simple, numerically identical in all 
time, and the correlate of all existence from which all other existence 
must be inferred, one can say not so much that is cognizes itself 
through the categories, but that it cognizes the categories, and through 
them all objects, in the absolute unity of apperception, and hence cognizes 
them through itself. Now it is indeed very illuminating that 1 cannot 
cognize as an objecta itself that which 1 must presuppose in order to 
cognize an objectb at all; and that the determining Self (the thinking) is 
different from the determinable Self (the thinking subject) as cognition 
is different from its object. Nevertheless, nothing is more natural and seductive 
than the illusion of taking the unity in the synthesis of thoughts 
for a perceived unity in the subject of these thoughts. One could call it 
the subreption of hypostatized consciousness (apperceptionis substantiate).c 
If one wants to give a logical title to the paralogism in the dialectical 
syllogisms of the rational doctrine of the soul, insofar as they have correct 
premises, then it can count as sophisma figurae diction is, d in which 
the major premise makes a merely transcendental use of the category, 
in regard to its condition, but in which the minor premise and the conclusion, 
in respect of the soul that is subsumed under this condition, 

A403 make an empirical use of the same category. Thus e.g., the concept of 
substance in the paralogism of simplicity is a pure intellectual concept, 
which in the absence of conditions of sensible intuition is merely of

Chapter I. On the paralogisms of pure reason <A> 

transcendental use, i.e., of no use at all. But in the minor premise the 
very same concept is applied to the object of all inner experience, yet 
without previously establishing it in concreto and grounding the condition 
of its application, namely its persistence; and hence here an empirical, 
though unreliable, use is being made of it. 

In order, finally, to show the systematic connection of all these dialectical 
assertions in a sophisticala doctrine of the soul, in a connection 
of pure reason, and hence to show its completeness, one notes that apperception 
is carried through by all classes of categories, but only toward 
those concepts of the understanding which in each class ground 
the unity of the remaining ones in a possible perception, consequently, 
subsistence, reality, unity (not plurality), and existence; yet reason represents 
them all here as conditions of the possibility of a thinking being, 
which are themselves unconditioned. Thus in itself the soul cognizes:

A405 Reason is the faculty of principles.a The assertions of pure psychology 
contain not empirical predicates of the soul, but rather those predicates 
which, if they exist, ought to determine the object in itself 
independently of experience, hence through mere reason. Thus they 
would properly have to be grounded on principles b and universal concepts 
of thinking nature in general. Instead, it turns out that one single 
representation, "I am," governs them all which, just because it expresses 
(indeterminately) what is purely formal in all my experience, proclaims 
itself as a universal proposition, valid for every thinking being, and 
which, since it is individual in all respects, brings with it the illusion of 
being an absolute unity of conditions of thought in general, and thereby 
extends itself farther than any possible experience could reach.

Now since the proposition I think (taken problematically) contains the B406 
form of every judgment of understanding whatever, and accompanies 
all categories as their vehicle, it is clear that the inferences from this 
proposition can contain a merely transcendental use of the understanding, 
excluding every admixture of experience; and ofb such a procedure, 
after what we have shown above, we cannot at the outset form 
any very favorable concept. Thus we will follow it through all the 
predications of the pure doctrine of the soul with a critical eye, <yet for 
the sake of brevity we will proceed to examine them in an uninterrupted 
exposition.c 

To begin with, the following general remarks can sharpen O!lJ: attentiveness 
to this mode of inference. I do not cognize any objectd merely 
by the fact that I think, but rather I can cognize any object only by de





termining a given intuition with regard to the unity of consclOusnesS;-inrwhich all thinking consists. Thus I cognize myself not by being conscious 
of myself as thinking, but only if I am conscious to myself of the 
intuition of myself as determined in regard to the function of thought. 
All modie of self-consciousness in thinking are therefore not yet them-B407 
selves concepts of the understanding of objects! (categories), but mere 
functions, which provide thought with no object at all, and hence also 
do not present my self as an object to be cognized. It is not the consciousness 
of the determining self, but only that of the determinable 
self, i.e., of my inner intuition (insofar as its manifold can be combined 
in accord with the universal condition of the unity of apperception in 
thinking), that is the object. g

I) Now in every judgment I am always the determining subject of 
a 

What follows is the portion of the "Paralogisms" chapter that was rewritten for the second 
edition. In the original, it follows the part of the text common to both editions 
without any interruption or new title. The new text actually begins with the last clause 
of the following paragraph.

that relationa that constitutes the judgment. However, that the I that I 
think can always be considered as subject, and as something that does 
not depend on thinking merely as a predicate, must be valid -this is an 
apodictic and even an identical proposition; but it does not signify 
that I as objectb am for myself a self-subsisting being or substance. 
The latter goes very far, and hence demands data that are not encountered 
at all in thinking, and thus (insofar as I consider merely what 
thinks as such) perhaps demands more than I will ever encounter anywhere 
(in it). 

2) That the I of apperception, consequently in every thought, is a 
single thing that cannot be resolved into a plurality of subjects, and 
hence a logically simple subject, lies already in the concept of thinking, 
B408 and is consequently an analytic proposition; but that does not signify 
that the thinking I is a simple substance, which would be a synthetic 
proposition. The concept of substance is always related to intuitions, 
which in me cannot be other than sensible, and hence must lie wholly 
outside the field of understanding and its thinking, which is all that is 
really under discussion here if it is said that the I in thinking is simple. 
It would also be miraculous if what otherwise requires so much care in 


order to distinguish what is the substance and what is displayed in intuition, 
and even more to tell whether this substance could be simple (as 
in the parts of matter), were given here so directly, in the poorest representation 
of all, as if by a revelation. 

3) The proposition of the identity of myself in everything manifold 
of which I am conscious is equally one lying in the concepts themselves, 
and hence an analytic proposition; but this identity of the subject, of 
which I can become conscious in every representation, does not concern 
the intuition of it, through which it is given as object,' and thus 
cannot signify the identity of the person, by which would be understood 
the consciousness of the identity of its own substance as a thinking 
being in all changes of state; in order to prove that what would be demanded 
is not a mere analysis of the proposition "I think," but rather 

B 409 various synthetic judgments grounded on the given intuition. 

4) [That] I distinguish my own existence, that of a thinking being, 
from other things outside me (to which my body also belongs) -this is 
equally an analytic proposition; for other things are those that I think of 
as distinguished from me. But I do not thereby know at all whether this 
consciousness of myself would even be possible without things outside 
me through which representations are given to me, and thus whether I 
could exist merely as a thinking being (without being a human being).

Thus through the analysis of the consciousness of myself in thinking 
in general not the least is won in regard to the cognition of myself as 
object.a The logical exposition of thinking in general is falsely held to 
be a metaphysical determination of the object.b 

It would be a great, or indeed the only stumbling block to our entire 
critique, if it were possible to prove a priori that all thinking beings are 
'in themselves simple substances, thus (as a consequence of the same 
ground of proof) that personality is inseparable from them, and that 
they are conscious of their existence as detached from all matter. For in 
this way we would have taken a step beyond the sensible world, entering 
into the field of noumena,c and then no one could deny that we are B 41 0 
entitled to extend ourselves farther into this field, settle in it, and, as far 
as each of us might be favored by an auspicious star, to take possession 
of it. For the proposition "Every thinking being as such is a simple substance" 
is a synthetic proposition a priori, first because it goes beyond 
the concept that grounds it by adding the way of existing to thinking 
in general and second because it adds to that concept a predicate (simplicity) 
that cannot be given in any experience whatever. Thus synthetic 
propositions a priori would not, as we have asserted, be feasible and accessible 
merely in relation to objects of possible experience, and in particular 
as principlesd of the possibility of this experience itself, but 
rather they could reach as far as things in general and in themselves, 
which consequence would put an end to this whole critique and would 
bid us to leave things the same old way they were before. Yet that danger 
is not so great here if one approaches nearer to the matter. 

The procedure of rational psychology is governed by a paralogism, 
which is exhibited through the following syllogism: 

What cannot be thought otherwise than as subject does not 
exist otherwise than as subject, and is therefore substance. 
Now a thinking being, considered merely as such, cannot be B4II 
thought otherwise than as subject. 
Therefore it also exists only as such a thing, i.e., as substance. 

The major premise talks about a being that can be thought of in 
every respect, and consequently even as it might be given in intuition. 
But the minor premise talks about this being only insofar as it is considered 
as subject, relative only to thinking and the unity of consciousness, 
but not at the same time in relation to the intuition 
through which it is given as an objecte for thinking. Thus the conclu

sion is drawn per Sophisma figurae dictionis,a hence by means of a deceptive 
inference. * 

B412 That this resolution of the famous argument into a paralogism is entirely 
correct shows itself clearly if one reviews in this connection the 
general remark to the systematic representation of the principlesb and 
the section on noumena,39 where it was proved that the concept of a 
thing that can exist for itself as subject but not as a mere predicate carries 
with it no objective reality at all, i.e., that one cannot know whether 
it applies to any object, since one has no insight into the possibility of 
such a way of existing, and consequently that it yields absolutely no cognition. 
Thus if that concept, by means of the term "substance," is to indicate 
an objectC that can be given, and if it is to become a cognition, 
then it must be grounded on a persisting intuition as the indispensable 
condition of the objective reality of a concept, namely, that through 

B413 which alone an object is given. But now we have in inner intuition nothing 
at all that persists, for the I is only the consciousness of my thinking; 
thus if we stay merely with thinking, we also lack the necessary 
condition for applying the concept of substance, i.e., of a subject subsisting 
for itself, to itself as a thinking being; and the simplicity of substance 
that is bound up with the objective reality of this concept completely 
falls away and is transformed into a merely logically qualitative 
unity of self-consciousness in thinking in general, whether or not the 
subject is composite. 

B 41 I * "Thinking" is taken in an entirely different signification in the two premises: 
in the major premise, as it applies to an objectd in general (hence as it may 
be given in intuition); but in the minor premise only as it subsists in relation 
to self-consciousness, where, therefore, no objecte is thought, but only the 
relation to oneself as subject (as the form of thinking) is represented. In the 
first premise, things are talked about that cannot be thought of other than as 
subjects; the second premise, however, talks not about things, but about 

B 41 2 thinking (in that one abstracts from every object),! in which the I always 
serves as subject of consciousness; hence in the conclusion it cannot follow 
that I cannot exist otherwise than as subject, but rather only that in thinking 
my existence I can use myself only as the subject of judgment, which is an 
identical proposition, that discloses absolutely nothing about the manner of 
my existence.

Refutation of Mendelssohn's proof 
of the persistence of the sou1.4° 


This acute philosopher soon noticed that the usual argument through 
which it is to be proved that the soul (if one grants that it is a simple 
being) cannot cease through disintegration, is insufficient for the aim 
of securing the soul's necessary continuing duration, since one could 
still assume cessation of its existence by vanishing. In his Phaedo, he 
sought to avoid this perishability, which would be a true annihilation, 
by attempting to prove that a simple being cannot cease to be at all because, 
since it cannot be diminished and thus lose more and more of its 
existence, and so be gradually transformed into nothing (since it has no B414 
parts and thus no plurality in itself), there would be no time at all between 
a moment in which it is and another moment in which it is not, 
which is impossible. -Yet he did not consider that even if we allow the 
soul this simple nature, namely, that it contains no manifold [of parts] 
outside one another, and hence no extensive magnitude, one nevertheless 
cannot deny to it, any more than to any other existence, an intensive 
magnitude, i.e., a degree of reality in regard to all its faculties, 
indeed to everything in general that constitutes its existence, which 
might diminish through all the infinitely many smaller degrees; and 
thus the supposed substance (the thing whose persistence has not been 
otherwise established already) could be transformed into nothing, although 
not by disintegration, but by a gradual remission (remissio) of all 
its powers (hence, if I may be allowed to use this expression, through 
elanguescence). For even consciousness always has a degree, which can 
always be diminished;* consequently, so does the faculty of being conscious 
of oneself, and likewise with all other faculties. -Thus the per-B415 
sistence of the soul, merely as an object of inner sense, remains 
unproved and even unprovable, although its persistence in life, where 
the thinking being (as a human being) is at the same time an object of 

* Clarity is not, as the logicians say, the consciousness of a representation;41 for B414 
a certain degree of consciousness, which, however, is not sufficient for memory, 
must be met with even in some obscure representations, because without 
any consciousness we would make no distinction in the combination of obscure 
representations; yet we are capable of doing this with the marks of some B415 
concepts (such as those of right and equity, or those of a musician who, when 
improvising, hits many notes at the same time). Rather a representation is 
clear if the consciousness in it is sufficient for a consciousness of the difference 
between it and others. To be sure, if this consciousness suffices for a distinction, 
but not for a consciousness of the difference, then the representation 
must still be called obscure. So there are infinitely many degrees of consciousness 
down to its vanishing.

outer sense, is clear of itself; but this is not at all sufficient for the ra


tional psychologist, who undertakes to prove from mere concepts the 

absolute persistence of the soul even beyond life.* 

B415 * Those who believe that they have done enough to get a new possibility started 
properly when they defy one to show a contradiction in its presuppositions (as 
are all those who believe that they have insight into the possibility of thinkB416 
ing even after life has ceased, though they have an example of thinking only 
through the empirical intuitions in human life) can be brought into great embarrassment 
through other possibilities that are not the least bit bolder. Such 
a possibility is the division of a simple substance into several substances, or 
conversely, the fusing together (coalition) of several substances into a simple 
one. For although divisibility presupposes a composite, what it requires is not 
necessarily a composite made up of substances, but merely a composite of degrees 
(of several faculties) of one and the same substance. Just as one can think 
of all the powers and faculties of the soul, even that of consciousness, as disappearing 
by halves, but in such a way that the substance always remains; so 
likewise one can without contradiction represent this extinguished half as preserved, 
yet not in it but outside it; onlya since everything real in it, consequently 
having a degree, and so its whole existence, lacking in nothing, has 
been halved, another particular substance would arise outside it. For the multiplicity 
that was divided already existed previously, yet not as a multiplicity of 
substances, but rather of that reality as a quantum of existence in it, b and the 
unity of substance was only a way of existing, which through this division 
B 41 7 alone is transformed into a plurality of subsistence. But in this way too several 
simple substances could once again fuse together into one, and nothing would 
be lost except merely the plurality of subsistence, since the one substance 
would contain the degree of reality of all the previous ones together in itself; 
and perhaps the simple substance, which gives us the appearance of a matter 
(though of course not through a mechanical or chemical influence on each 
other, but through one unknown to us, of which these would be only the appearance) 
might produce offspring-souls through such a dynamic division of 
the parent-souls, as intensive magnitudes, which would meanwhile replace 
what had departed from them by a coalition with new material of the same 
kind. I am far from allowing any worth or validity to such figments of the 
brain, and the above principles' of the Analytic have sufficiently enjoined us 
to make none other than an experiential use of the categories (such as substance). 
But if the rationalist is keen to make the mere faculty of thinking into 
a self-subsisting being without any persisting intuition through which an object 
is given, merely because for him the unity of apperception in thinking 
B418 allows of no explanation from something composite, instead of admitting, as 
would be better to do, that he does not know how to explain the possibility of

On the paralogisms of pure reason <B> 
If we take the above propositions in a synthetic connection, as valid B 41 6 
for all thinking beings, as they must be taken in rational psychology as 
a system, and if from the category of relation,a starting with the proposition 
"All thinking beings are, as such, substances" we go backward B417 
through the series of propositions until the circle closes, then we finally 
come up against the existence of thinking beings, which in this system 
are conscious of themselves not only as independent of external things 
but also as being able to determine themselves from themselves (in regard 
to the persistence belonging necessarily to the character of a subB418 
stance). But from this it follows that idealism, at least problematic 
idealism, is unavoidable in that same rationalistic system, and if the existence 
of external things is not at all required for the determination of 
one's own existence in time, then such things are only assumed, entirely 
gratuitously, without a proof of them being able to be given. 
If, on the contrary, we follow the analytic procedure, grounded on 
the "I think" given as a proposition that already includes existence in itself, 
and hence grounded on modality, and then we take it apart so as to 
cognize its content, whether and how this I determines its existence in 
space or time merely through it, then the propositions of the ratiortal 
doctrine of the soul begin not from the concept of a thinking being in 
general but from an actuality; and from the way this is thought, after 
everything empirical has been detached from it, it is concluded what B419 
pertains to a thinking being in general, as the following table shows. 
1. 
I think, 
2. 3· 
as subject, as simple subject, 
4· 
as identical subject 
in every state of my thinking. 
Now because in the second proposition here it is not determined 
whether I could exist and be thought of only as subject and not as predicate 
of another thing, the concept of a subject is here taken merely logically, 
and it remains undetermined whether or not substance is to be 
understood by it. Yet in the third proposition the absolute unity of apa 
thinking nature, then why should not the materialist, even though he can 
just as little present any experience in behalf of his possibilities, be justified in 
an equal boldness, retaining the rationalist's formal unity while putting his 
own principle to an opposite use?

perception, the simple I, in the representation to which every combination 
or separation constituting thought is related, also becomes important 
for its own sake,a even if I have not settled anything about the 
subject's constitution or subsistence. Apperception is something real, 
and its simplicity lies already in its possibility. Now there is nothing real 
in space that is simple; for points (which constitute the only simple entities 
in space) are mere bounds, and not themselves something that 

B420 serves to constitute space as parts. Thus from this follows the impossibility 
of explaining how I am constituted as a merely thinking subject 
on the basis of materialism. But because my existence in the first 
proposition is considered as given, since it does not say that every thinking 
being exists (which would at the same time predicate absolute necessity 
of them, and hence say too much), but only "I exist thinking," 
that proposition is empirical, and contains the determinability of my existence 
merely in regard to my representations in time. But since for 
this once again I first need something persisting, and, just insofar as I 
think myself, nothing of the sort is given to me in inner intuition, it is 
not possible at all through this simple self-consciousness to determine 
the way I exist, whether as substance or as accident. Thus if materialism 
will not work as a way of explaining my existence, then spiritualism 
is just as unsatisfactory for it, and the conclusion is that in no way 
whatsoever can we cognize anything about the constitution of our soul 
that in any way at all concerns the possibility of its separate existence. 
And how should it be possible to go beyond experience (of our existence 
in life) through the unity of consciousness with which we are acquainted 
only because we have an indispensable need of it for the 
possibility of experience, and even to extend our cognition to the nature 

B42 I of all thinking beings in general, through the empirical but in regard to 
all kinds of intuition indeterminate proposition "I think"? 
Thus there is no rational psychology as doctrine that might provide 
us with an addition to our self-consciousness, but only as discipline, 
setting impassable boundaries for speculative reason in this field, in 
order, on the one side, not to be thrown into the lap of a soulless materialism, 
or on the other side not to get lost wandering about in a spiritualism 
that must be groundless for us in life; on the contrary, it rather 
reminds us to regard this refusal of our reason to give an answer to 
those curious questions, which reach beyond this life, as reason's hint 
that we should turn our self-knowledgeb away from fruitless and extravagant 
speculation toward fruitful practical uses, which, even if it is always 
directed only to objects of experience, takes its principlesc from 

a for sich 
b Selbsterkenntnis 
, Principien 
452 

On the paralogisms of pure reason <B> 

somewhere higher, and so determines our behavior, as if our vocationa 
extended infinitely far above experience, and hence above this life. 

From all this one sees that rational psychology has its origin in a mere 
misunderstanding. The unity of consciousness, which grounds the categories, 
is here taken for an intuition of the subject as an object,b and the 
category of substance is applied to it. But this unity is only the unity of B422 
thinking, through which no objectC is given; and thus the category of 
substance, which always presupposes a given intuition, cannot be applied 
to it, and hence this subject cannot be cognized at all. Thus the subject of 
the categories cannot, by thinking them, obtain a concept of itself as an 
objectd of the categories; for in order to think them, it must take its pure 
self-consciousness, which is just what is to be explained, as its ground. 
Likewise, the subject, in which the representation of time originally has 
its ground, cannot thereby determine its own existence in time, and if the 
latter cannot be, then the former as a determination of its self (as a thinking 
being in general) through categories can also not take place. * 

* The "I think" is, as has already been said, an empirical proposition, and con-B422 
tains within itself the proposition "I exist." But I cannot say "Everything that 
thinks, exists"; for then the property of thinking would make all beings possessing 
it into necessary beings. Hence my existence also cannot be regarded 
as inferred from the proposition "I think," as Descartes held (for otherwise the 
major premise, "Everything that thinks, exists" would have to precede it), but 
rather it is identical with it.4' It expresses an indeterminate empirical intuition, 
i.e., a perception (hence it proves that sensation, which consequendy be-B 42 3 
longs to sensibility, grounds this existential proposition), but it precedes the 
experience that is to determine the object e of perception through the category 
in regard to time; and here existence is not yet a category, which is not related 
to an indeterminately given object, but rather to an object of which one has a 
concept, and about which one wants to know whether or not it is posited outside 
this concept. An indeterminate perception here signifies only something 
real, which was given, and indeed only to thinking in general, thus not as appearance, 
and also not as a thing in itself (a noumenon), but rather as something 
that in fact exists and is indicated as an existing thing in the proposition 
"I think." For it is to be noted that if I have called the proposition "I think" 
an empirical proposition, I would not say by this that the I in this proposition 
is an empirical representation; for it is rather purely intellectual, because it 
belongs to thinking in general. Only without any empirical representation, 
which provides the material for thinking, the act I think would not take place, 
and the empirical is only the condition of the application, or use, of the pure 
intellectual faculty.43

B424 
In this way, then, a cognition going beyond the bounds of possible experience 
yet belonging to the highest interests of humanity disappears, 
as far as speculative philosophy is concerned, in disappointed expectation; 
nevertheless the strictness of critique, by proving the impossibility 
of settling anything dogmatically about an object of experience 
beyond the bounds of experience, performs a not unimportant service 


for reason regarding this interest, in securing it likewise against all 
possible assertions of the contrary; this cannot be done otherwise than 
by proving one's proposition apodictically, or, if that does not succeed, 
then by seeking the sources of this incapacity, which, if they lie in 
the necessary limits of our reason, must then subject every opponent 
to exactly the same law of renunciation for all claims to dogmatic 
assertions. 

Nevertheless, not the least bit is lost through this regarding the warrant, 
or indeed the necessity, for the assumption of a future life in accordance 
with principles of the practical use of reason, which is bound 
up with its speculative use; for in any case the merely speculative proof 
has never been able to have an influence on common human reason. It 
so turns on a hairsplitting point that even the schools can retain it only 
as long as they can keep it standing there spinning around ceaselessly 
like a top, and thus even in their own eyes it provides no persisting 
foundation on which anything could be built. Here all the proofs that 

B425 the world can use preserve their undiminished worth, and rather gain 
in clarity and unaffected conviction through the removal of those dogmatic 
pretensions, since they place reason in its proper territory, namely 
the order of ends that is yet at the same time an order of nature; but 
then since reason exists at the same time as a practical faculty in itself, 
without being limited to the conditions of the latter order, it is justified 
in extending the former order, and with it our whole existence, beyond 
the bounds of experience and life. By analogy with the nature of living 
beings in this world, regarding which reason must assume as a necessary 
principle that no organ, no faculty, nothing superfluous, or 
disproportionate to its use, hence nothing purposeless is to be met with, 
but rather that everything is to be judged as precisely suitable to its 
functiona in life, the human being, who alone can contain within himself 
the ultimate final en db of all this, would have to be the only creature 
excepted from it. For his natural predispositions, not only his 
talents and the drives to make use of them, but chiefly the moral law in

him, go so far beyond all the utility and advantage that he could draw 
from them in this life that the latter teaches him to esteem above all else 
the mere consciousness of a disposition to rectitude, even in the absence 
of any advantage, even of the phantom of posthumous fame, and he B426 
feels himself called inwardly, through his conduct in this world, and the 
sacrifice of many advantages, to make himself a suitable citizen of a better 
one, which he has in its idea. This powerful ground of proof, which 
can never be refuted, accompanied by an ever increasing cognition of 
the purposiveness in everything we see and by a vision of the immensity 
of creation, hence also by the consciousness of a certain boundlessness 
in the possible extension of our knowledge, a along with a drive 
commensurate to it, always still remains, even if we must equally give 
up insight into the necessary continuation of our existence from the 
merely theoretical cognition of our self. 


Conclusion of the solution of the psychological 
paralogism. 
The dialectical illusion in rational psychology rests on the confusion of 
an idea of reason (of a pure intelligence) with the concept, in every way 
indeterminate, of a thinking being in general. I think of my self, in behalf 
of a possible experience, by abstracting from all actual experience, 
and from this conclude that I could become conscious of my existence 
even outside experience and of its empirical conditions. Consequently I B427 
confuse the possible abstraction from my empirically determined existence 
with the supposed consciousness of a separate possible existence 
of my thinking Self, and believe that I cognize what is substantial in me 
as a transcendental subject, since I have in thought merely the unity of 
consciousness that grounds everything determinate as the mere form of 
cognition. 

The problem of explaining the community of the soul with the body 
does not properly belong to the psychology that is here at issue, because 
it intends to prove the personality of the soul even outside this community 
(after death), and so it is transcendent in the proper sense, even 
though it concerns an objectb of experience, but only to the extent that 
it ceases to be an object of experience. Meanwhile in accord with our 
doctrineC a sufficient reply can also be given to this problem. The difficulty 
presented by this problem consists, as is well known, in the presumed 
difference in kind between the object of inner sense (the soul) and 

a Kenntnisse 
b Object 
, Lehrbegriff 


455 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. I <B> 

the object of outer sense, since to the former only time pertains as the 
formal condition of its intuition, while to the latter space pertains also. 
But if one considers that the two kinds of objects are different not inwardly 
but only insofar as one of them appears outwardly to the other, 

B428 hence that what grounds the appearance of matter as thing in itself 
might perhaps not be so different in kind, then this difficulty vanishes, 
and the only difficulty remaining is that concerning how a community 
of substances is possible at all, the resolution of which lies entirely outside 
the field of psychology, and, as the reader can easily judge from what 
was said in the Analytic about fundamental powers and faculties, this 
without any doubt also lies outside the field of all human cognition. 


General remark 
concerning the transition from rational psychology 
to cosmology. 

The proposition "I think," or "I exist thinking," is an empirical proposition. 
But such a proposition is grounded on empirical intuition, consequently 
also on the object thought, as an appearance; and thus it 
seems as if, according to our theory, the whole, even in thinking, is 
completely transformed into appearance, and in such a way our consciousness 
itself, as mere illusion, would in fact come down to nothing.o 
Thinking, taken in itself,b is merely the logical function and hence 


the sheer spontaneity of combining the manifold of a merely possible 

intuition; and in no way does it present the subject of consciousness as 

B429 appearance, merely because it takes no account at all of the kind of intuition, 
whether it is sensible or intellectual. In this way I represent myself 
to myself neither as I am nor as I appear to myself, but rather I think 
myself only as I do every objectd in general from whose kind of intuition 
I abstract. If here I represent myself as subject of a thought or even as 
ground of thinking, then these ways of representing do not signify the 
categories of substance or cause, for these categories are those functions 
of thinking (of judging) applied to our sensible intuition, which would 
obviously be demanded if I wanted to cognize myself. But now I want 
to become conscious of myself only as thinking; I put to one side how 
my proper self is given in intuition, and then it could be a mere appearance 
that I think, but not insofar as I think; in the consciousness of 
myself in mere thinking I am the being itself, about which, however, 
nothing yet is thereby given to me for thinking.

But the proposition "I think," insofar as it says only that I exist 
thinking, is not a merely logical function, but rather determines the 
subject (which is then at the same time an object)O in regard to existence, 
and this cannot take place without inner sense, whose intuition always 
makes available the objectb not as thing in itself but merely as appearance. 
Thus in this proposition there is already no longer merely spon-B430 
taneity of thinking, but also receptivity of intuition, i.e., the thinking of 
my self applied to the empirical intuition of the very same subject. It is 
in this latter that the thinking self must now seek the conditions of the 
use of its logical functions for categories of substance, cause, etc., so as 
not merely to indicate itself as objectC in itself through the "I," but also 
to determine its kind of existence, i.e., to cognize it as noumenon; 
which, however, is impossible, since inner empirical intuition is sensible, 
and makes available nothing but data of appearance, which affords nothing 
for knowledge of the separate existence of the objectd of pure consciousness, 
but can serve merely in behalf of experience. 


But suppose there subsequently turned up -not in experience but in 
certain (not merely logical rules but) laws holding firm a priori and concerning 
our existence -the occasion for presupposing ourselves to be 
legislative fully a priori in regard to our own existence, e and as self-determining 
in this existence! then this would disclose a spontaneity 
through which our actuality is determinable without the need of conditions 
of empirical intuition; and here we would become aware that in 
the consciousness of our existence something is ,􀊾ontained a priori that 
can serve to determine our existence, which is thoroughly determinable B 43s1 
only sensibly, in regard to a certain inner faculty in relation to an intelligible 
world (obviously one only thought of). 

But this would nonetheless bring all the attempts of rational psychology 
not the least bit further. For through this admirable faculty, 
which for the first time reveals to me the consciousness of the moral 
law, I would indeed have a principleg for the determination of my 
existence that is purely intellectual; but through which predicates? 
Through none other than those that would have to be given to me in 
sensible intuition, and thus I would have landed right back where I was 
in rational psychology, namely in need of sensible intuitions in order 
to obtain significance for my concepts of the understanding, substance, 
cause, etc.; but those intuitions can never help me up beyond the field

of experience. Meanwhile, I would still be warranted in applying these 
concepts in regard to their practical use, which is always directed to 
objects of experience, according to their analogical significance in their 
theoretical use, to freedom and the free subject, since by them I understand 
merely the logical functions of subject and predicate, ground 
and consequence, in accordance with which actions or effects are de


B432 termined in conformity to those laws in such a way that they can at the 
same time always be explained conformably to the laws of nature and

wholly different principle.a This should have been said only to guard 
against a misunderstanding that easily arises regarding this doctrine 
about our self-intuition as appearance. In the following there will be 
opportunity to make use of it.>

The antinomy of pure reason44 
We have shown in the introduction to this part of our work that every 
transcendental illusion of pure reason rests on dialectical inferences, 
whose schema is provided in general by logic in the three formal species 
of syllogisms, just as the categories find their logical schema in the four A406 
functions of all judgments. The first species of these sophistical inferences 
had to do with the unconditioned unity of the subjective conditions 
of all representations in general (of the subject or the soul), 
corresponding to the categorical syllogisms, whose major premise, as a 
principle,a states the relation of a predicate to a subject. Thus the sec-B433 
ond species of dialectical argument, by analogy with hypothetical syllogisms, 
will make the unconditioned unity of objective conditions in 
appearance its content, just as the third species, which will come forward 
in the following chapter, has as its theme the unconditioned unity 
of objective conditions of the possibility of objects in general. 

It is remarkable, however, that the transcendental paralogism effects 
a merely one-sided illusion regarding the idea of the subject of our 
thought, and for the opposite assertion there is not the least plausibilityb 
forthcoming from concepts of reason. The advantage is entirely on 
the side of pneumatism, even though pneumatism cannot deny that radical 
defect through which its entire plausibility dissolves into mere haze 
when put to the fiery test of critique.45 

It turns out wholly otherwise when we apply reason to the objective 
synthesis of appearances, where reason thinks to make its principlec of A407 
unconditioned unity valid with much plausibility;d but it soon finds it

selfinvolved in such contradictions that it is compelled to relinquish its 
demands in regard to cosmology. 
Here a new phenomenon of human reason shows itself, namely a 
wholly natural antithetic, for which one does not need to ponder or to 
B434 lay artificial snares, but rather into which reason falls of itself and even 
unavoidably; and thus it guards reason against the slumber of an imagined 
conviction, such as a merely one-sided illusion produces, but at the 
same time leads reason into the temptation either to surrender itself to 
a skeptical hopelessness or else to assume an attitude of dogmatic stubbornness, 
setting its mind rigidly to certain assertions without giving a 
fair hearing to the grounds for the opposite. Either alternative is the 
death of a healthy philosophy, though the former might also be called 
the euthanasia of pure reason. 
Before we allow the divisions and dissensions occasioned by this contradiction 
in the laws (antinomy) of pure reason to make their entrance, 
we will offer certain elucidations that can classify and justify the method 
we will employ in treating our subject matter. I call all transcendental 
ideas, insofar as they concern absolute totality in the synthesis of appear


A408 ances, world-concepts,46 partly because of the unconditioned totality on 
which the concept of the world-whole also rests even though it is only an 
idea, and partly because they have to do merely with the synthesis of appearances, 
and hence with the empirical, whereas the absolute totality of 
the synthesis of the condition of all possible things in general will occa


B435 sion an ideal of pure reason, which is wholly distinct from the world-concept, 
even though it stands in relation to it. Hence just as the paralogism 
of pure reason laid the ground for a dialectical psychology, so the antinomy 
of pure reason will put before our eyes the transcendental principles 
of an alleged pure (rational) cosmology, yet not in order to find it valid 
and to appropriate it, but rather, as is already indicated by terming it a 
contradiction of reason, in order to display it in its dazzling but false 
plausibilitya as an idea that cannot be made to agree with appearances.

Now in order to be able to enumerate these ideas with systematic precision 
according to aprinciple,b we must first note that it is only from 
the understanding that pure and transcendental concepts can arise, that 
A409 reason really cannot generate any concept at all, but can at most only 
free a concept of the understanding from the unavoidable limitations

of a possible experience, and thus seek to extend it beyond the boundaries 
of the empirical, though still in connection with it. This happens B436 
when for a given conditioned reason demands an absolute totality on 
the side of the conditions (under which the understanding subjects all 
appearances to synthetic unity), thereby making the category into a 
transcendental idea, in order to give absolute completeness to the empirical 
synthesis through its progress toward the unconditioned (which 
is never met with in experience, but only in the idea). Reason demands 
this in accordance with the principle: If the conditioned is given, then 
the whole sum of conditions, and hence the absolutely unconditioned, 
is also given, through which alone the conditioned was possible.
47 Thus first, the transcendental ideas will really be nothing except 
categories extended to the unconditioned, and the former may be 
brought into a table ordered according to the headings of the latter. 
Second, however, not all categories will work here, but only those in 
which the synthesis constitutes a series, and indeed a series of conditions 
subordinated (not coordinated) one to another for any conditioned. 
Absolute totality is demanded by reason only insofar as reason 
is concerned with the ascending series of conditions for a given condi-A4IO 
tioned, hence not when dealing with the descending line of consequences, 
nor with the aggregate of coordinated conditions for these 
consequences. For in regard to the given conditioned, conditions are B43s7 
regarded as already presupposed and given along with the conditioned; 
whereas, since the consequences do not make their conditions possible, 
but rather presuppose them, in proceeding to the consequences (or in 
descending from a given condition to the conditioned) one remains untroubled 
about whether or not in general the series stops, and the question 
about its totality is not at all a presupposition of reason. 

Thus one necessarily thinks of the fully elapsed time up to the present 
moment as also given (even if not as determinable by us). But as to the 
future, since it is not a condition for attaining to the present, it is a matter 
of complete indifference for comprehending the present what we 
want to hold about future time, whether it stops somewhere or runs on 
to infinity. Let there be a series m, n, 0, in which n is given as conditioned 
in respect of m, but at the same time as the condition of 0, and the series 
ascends from the conditioned n to m (/, k,j, etc.); then I must presuppose 
the first series in order to regard n as given, and n is possible in accordance 
with reason (with the totality of conditions) only by means of that A41 I 
series; but its possibility does not rest on the subsequent series 0, p, q, r, 
which therefore cannot" be regarded as given, but only as dabilis. b B438

I will call the synthesis of a series on the side of the conditions, thus 
proceeding from the condition proximate to the given appearance toward 
the more remote conditions, the regressive synthesis, and the 
synthesis proceeding on the side of the conditioned, from its proximate 
consequence to the more remote ones, the progressive synthesis. The 
first proceeds in antecedienta, a the second in consequentia. b Thus the cosmological 
ideas are concerned with the totality of the regressive synthesis, 
and go in antecedentia, not in consequentia. If this latter happens, 
then that is an arbitrary and not a necessary problem of pure reason, because 
for the complete comprehensibility of what is given in appearance 
we need its grounds but not its consequences. 

Now in order to set up a table of ideas according to the table of categories, 
we first take the two original quanta of all intuition, space and 
time. Time is in itself a series (and the formal condition of all series), 
and hence in it, in regard to a given present, the antecedentia are to be 
distinguished a priori as conditions (the past) from the consequentiaC (the 
future). Consequently, the transcendental idea of an absolute totality of 
the series of conditions for a given conditioned applies only to all past 
time. According to the idea of reason, the whole elapsed past time is 
thought of as given necessarily as the condition for the given moment. 
But as for space, in it there is no difference between progress and 
regress, because it constitutes an aggregate, but not a series, since all 
its parts exist simultaneously. I could regard the present point in time 
only as conditioned in regard to past time but never as its condition, because 
this moment first arises only through the time that has passed (or 
rather through the passing of the preceding time). But since the parts 
of space are not subordinated to one another but are coordinated with 
one another, one part is not the condition of the possibility of another, 
and space, unlike time, does not in itself constitute a series. Yet the synthesis 
of the manifold parts of space, through which we apprehend it, is 
nevertheless successive, and thus occurs in time and contains a series.48 
And since in this series of aggregated spaces of a given space (e.g., the 
feet in a rod), the further spaces, starting with a given one, are each 
thought of as the condition of the boundaries of the previous ones, 
the measurement of a space is to be regarded as a synthesis of a series 
of conditions for a given conditioned; only the side of the conditions is 
not in itself distinguished from the side lying beyond the conditioned, 
consequently regressus and progressus in space appear to be one and the 
same.49 Nonetheless, because a part of space is not given through an-

other part but is only bounded by it, we must to that extent regard every 
bounded space as also conditioned, presupposing another space as the 
condition of its boundary, and so forth. Thus regarding boundedness, 
the progression is also a regress, and the transcendental idea of the absolute 
totality of a synthesis in the series of conditions also applies to 
space, and I can ask about the absolute totality of appearances in space 
as well as in past time. But whether an answer to any of these questions 
is possible will be determined in the future. 

Second, reality in space, i.e., matter, is likewise something conditioned, 
whose inner conditions are its parts, and the parts of those parts 
are the remote conditions, so that there occurs here a regressive synthesis, 
whose absolute totality reason demands; and that cannot occur 
otherwise than through a complete division, in which the reality of matter 
disappears either into nothing or else into that which is no longer 
matter, namely the simple. 50 Consequently here too there is a series of 
conditions and a progress toward the unconditioned. 

Third, as far as the categories of real relation among appearances are 
concerned, the category of substance and its accidents is not suited to a 
transcendental idea, i.e., in regard to this category reason has no ground 
to proceed regressively toward conditions. For accidents (insofar as 
they inhere in a single substance) are coordinated with one another, and 
do not constitute a series. In regard to substance, however, they are not 
really subordinated to it, but are rather the way substance itself exists. 
What might still seem to be an idea of transcendental reason here 
would be the concept of the substantial. Only since this signifies nothing 
other than the concept of a subsisting object in general, insofar as 
one thinks in it merely the transcendental subject without any predicates, 
but here only the unconditioned in a series of appearances is 
under discussion, it is clear that the substantial cannot constitute a 
member of thatY The same holds for substances in community, which 
are mere aggregates and have no exponents of a series, since they are 
not subordinated to one another as conditions of their possibility, which 
one could very well have said about spaces, whose boundaries were 
never determined in themselves, but always through another space. 
Thus there remains only the category of causality, which provides a series 
of causes for a given effect, in which one can ascend from the effect 
as the conditioned to the causes as conditions, and answer the question 
of reason.52 

Fourth, the concepts of the possible, actual, and necessary lead to no 
series, except only insofar as the contingent in existence always has to 
be seen as conditioned and refers in accordance with the rule of the understanding 
to a condition under which it is necessary to refer this to a 
higher condition, until reason attains to unconditioned necessity only 
in the series in its totality. 53

There are, accordingly, no more than four cosmological ideas, according 
to the four headings of the categories, if one selects those that 
necessarily carry with them a series in the synthesis of the manifold.

A416 The first thing to be noted here is that the idea of an absolute totality 
concerns nothing other than the expositionc of appearances, hence 
it does not concern the understanding's pure concept of a whole of 
things in general. Thus appearances are considered here as given, and 
reason demands the absolute completeness of the conditions of their 
possibility, insofar as these conditions constitute a series, hence an absolutely 
(i.e., in all respects) complete synthesis, through which appearance 
could be expoundedd in accordance with laws of the understanding. 
Second, it is properly only the unconditioned that reason seeks in this 
synthesis of conditions, which proceeds serially, and indeed regressively, 
hence as it were the completeness in the series of premises that together 
presuppose no further premise. Now this unconditioned is always contained 
in the absolute totality of the series if one represents it in 
imagination. Yet this absolutely complete synthesis is once again only 
an idea; for with appearances one cannot know, at least not beforehand,

whether such a synthesis is even possible. If one represents everything 
through mere pure concepts of the understanding, without the conditions 
of sensible intuition, then one can say directly that for a given 
conditioned the whole series of conditions subordinated one to another 
is given; for the former is given only through the latter. But with appearances 
a special limitation is encountered in the way conditions are 
given, namely through the successive synthesis of the manifold of intuition, 
which is supposed to be complete in the regress. Now whether 
this completeness is sensibly possible is still a problem. Yet the idea of 
this completeness still lies in reason, irrespective of the possibility or 
impossibility of connecting empirical concepts to it adequately. Thus, 
since the unconditioned is necessarily contained in the absolute totality B445 
of the regressive synthesis of the manifold in appearance (following the 
categories, which represent appearance as a series of conditions for a 
given conditioned), one might also leave it undecided whether and how 
this totality is to be brought about; here reason thus takes the path of 
proceeding from the idea of a totality, even though it really has as its 
final intent the unconditioned, whether of the whole series or one part 
of it. 


Now one can think of this unconditioned either as subsisting merely 
in the whole series, in which thus every member without exception is 
conditioned, and only their whole is absolutely unconditioned, or else 
the absolutely unconditioned is only a part of the series, to which the 
remaining members of the series are subordinated but that itself stands 
under no other condition. * In the first case the series is given a parte pri


ori without bounds (without a beginning), i.e., it is given as infinite and 
at the same time whole, but the regress in it is never complete and can 
be called only potentia/itera infinite. In the second case there is a first 
[member] in the series, which in regard to past time is called the beginning 
of the world, in regard to space and boundary of the world, 
in regard to the parts of a whole given in its bounds the simple, in regard 
to causes absolute self-activity (freedom), in regard to the existence 
of alterable things absolute natural necessity. 

We have two expressions, world and nature, which are sometimes 
run together. The first signifies the mathematical whole of all appear


* The absolute whole of the series of conditions for a given conditioned is always 
unconditioned, because outside it there are no more conditions regarding 
which it could be conditioned. But the absolute whole of such a series is 
only an idea, or rather a problematic concept, whose possibility has to be investigated, 
particularly in reference to the way in which the unconditioned 
may be contained in it as the properly transcendental idea that is at issue.

ances and the totality of their synthesis in the great as well as in the 
small, i.e., in their progress through compositiona as well as through division. 
But the very same world is called nature* insofar as it is considered 
as a dynamic whole and one does not look at the aggregation in 
space or time so as to bring about a quantity, but looks instead at the 
unity in the existence of appearances. Now the condition of what happens 
is called the cause, and the unconditioned causality of the cause in 
appearance is called freedom; the conditioned cause in the narrower 
sense, on the contrary, is called the natural cause. The conditioned in 
existence in general is called contingent, and the unconditioned necessary. 
The unconditioned necessity of appearances can be called natural 
necessity. 

Above I have called the ideas with which we are now concerned "cosmological 
ideas," partly because by "world" is understood the sum total 
of all appearances, and our ideas are also directed only toward the unconditioned 
among appearances, but partly too because in the transcendental 
sense the word "world" signities the absolute totality of the 
sum total of existing things, and we are directing our attention only to 
the completeness of the synthesis (though properly only in the regress 
toward its conditions). Considering, moreover, that taken collectively 
these ideas are all transcendent and, even though they do not overstep 
the object,b namely appearances, in kind, but have to do only with the 
sensible world (not with noumena), c they nevertheless carry the synthesis 
to a degree that transcends all possible experience; thus in myropinion 
one can quite appropriately call them collectively world-concepts. 
In regard to the distinction between the mathematically and the dynamically 
unconditioned toward which the regress aims, I would call 
the first two world-concepts in a narrower sense (the world in great and 

* "Nature" taken adjectivally lformaliter)d signifies the connection of determinations 
of a thing in accordance with an inner principle' of causality. 
Conversely, by "nature" taken substantively (materialiter! is understood the 
sum total of appearances insofar as these are in thoroughgoing connection 
through an inner principleg of causality. In the first sense one speaks of the 
"nature" of fluid matter, of fire, etc., and employs this word adjectivally; conversely, 
if one talks about the "things of nature," then one has in mind a subsisting 
whole.

to now this distinction has been of no particular relevance, but as we 
proceed it may become more important. 

The 
Antinomy of Pure Reason 
Second Section 
Antithetic of pure reason. 


If any sum total of dogmatic doctrines is a "thetic," then by "antithetic" 
I understand not the dogmatic assertion of the opposite but rather the 
conflict between what seem to be dogmatic cognitions (thesin cum antithesl),
a without the ascription of a preeminent claim to approval of one 
side or the other. Thus an antithetic does not concern itself with one-A42 I 
sided assertions, but considers only the conflict between general cognitions 
of reason and the causes of this conflict. The transcendental 
antithetic is an investigation into the antinomy of pure reason, its causes 
and its result. If in using principles of the understanding we apply our 
reason not merely to objects of experience, for the use of principles of B 449 
understanding, but instead venture also to extend these principles beyond 
the boundaries of experience, then there arise sophistical theorems,
b which may neither hope for confirmation in experience nor fear 
refutation by it; and each of them is not only without contradiction in 
itself but even meets with conditions of its necessity in the nature of 
reason itself, only unfortunately the opposite has on its side equally 
valid and necessary grounds for its assertion. 

The questions that are naturally presented by such a dialectic of pure 
reason are these: I. In which propositions is pure reason inevitably really 
subjected to an antinomy? 2. On what causes does this antinomy 
rest? 3. In what way, if any, given this contradiction, does a path to certainty 
nevertheless remain open to reason? 

A dialectical theorem of pure reason must accordingly have the following 
feature, distinguishing it from all sophisticale propositions: it 
does not concern an arbitrary question that one might raise only at A422 
one's option, but one that every human reason must necessarily come 
up against in the course of its progress; and second, this proposition and 
its opposite must carry with them not merely an artificial illusion that 
disappears as soon as someone has insight into it, but rather a natural 
and unavoidable illusion, which even if one is no longer fooled by it, B450 

a "thesis with antithesis." The correct Latin would be thesis; Kant does not seem to have 
made up his mind whether the phrase is supposed to be in Latin or in Greek. 

b vernunftelnde Lehrsdtze

467 



Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. II 

still deceives though it does not defraud and which thus can be rendered 
harmless but never destroyed. 

Such a dialectical doctrine will relate not to the unity of understanding 
in concepts of experience, but to the unity of reason in mere ideas, 
whose conditions, since, as a synthesis according to rules, must first be 
congruent with the understanding, and yet at the same time, as the absolute 
unity of this synthesis, must be congruent with reason, will be too 
large for the understanding if this unity is to be adequate to the unity of 
reason, and yet too small for reason if they are suited to the understanding; 
from this there must arise a contradiction that cannot be 
avoided no matter how one may try. 

These sophisticala assertions thus open up a dialectical battlefield, 
where each party will keep the upper hand as long as it is allowed to atA423 
tack, and will certainly defeat that which is compelled to conduct itself b 
merely defensively. Hence hardy knights, whether they support the 
good or the bad cause, are certain of carrying away the laurels of victory 
if only they take care to have the prerogative of making the last attack, 
and are not bound to resist a new assault from the opponent. One can 
easily imagine that from time immemorial this arena has often been entered, 
both sides gaining many victories, but that each time the final 

B4SI victory was decisive merely because care was taken that the champion 
of the good cause held the field alone, his opponent having been forbidden 
to take up his weapons again. As impartial referees we have to 
leave entirely aside whether it is a good or a bad cause for which the 
combatants are fighting, and just let them settle the matter themselves. 
Perhaps after they have exhausted rather than injured each other, they 
will see on their own that their dispute is nugatory, and part as good 
friends. 
This method of watching or even occasioning a contest between assertions, 
not in order to decide it to the advantage of one party or the 
other, but to investigate whether the object of the dispute is not perhaps 
a mere mirage at which each would snatch in vain without being able 

A424 to gain anything even if he met with no resistance -this procedure, I 
say, can be called the skeptical method. It is entirely different from 
skepticism, a principle of artfuld and scientific ignorance that undermines 
the foundations of all cognition, in order, if possible, to leave no 
reliability or certainty anywhere. For the skeptical method aims at certainty, 
seeking to discover the point of misunderstanding in disputes

Section II. The antithetic of pure reason 
sides, in order to do as wise legislators do when from the embarrassment 
of judges in cases of litigation they draw instruction concerning 
that which is defective and imprecisely determined in their laws. The 
antinomy that reveals itself in the application of the law is for our limited 
wisdom the best way to test nomothetics,a in order to make reason, 
which does not easily become aware of its false steps in abstract speculation, 
attentive to the moments involved in determining its principles. 
This skeptical method, however, is essentially suited only to transcendental 
philosophy, and can in any case be dispensed with in every 
other field of investigation, but not in this one. In mathematics its use 
would be absurd, because nowhere in mathematics do false assertions 
disguise themselves and make themselves invisible; for mathematical 
proofs always have to proceed along the lines of pure intuition, and inA425 
deed always through a self-evident synthesis. In experimental philosophy 
a doubt postponing judgment can be useful, but at least there is no 
possible misunderstanding that cannot be easily removed, and the ultimate 
means for deciding the controversy must at last lie in experience, 
whether it is found early or late. Morality can also give us its principles 
as a whole in concreto, along with their practical consequences in at least B453 
possible experiences, and thereby avoid misunderstandings due to abstraction. 
On the contrary, the transcendental assertions that presume 
to extend their insight beyond the field of all possible experience are 
neither in the case where their synthesis could be given in an a priori intuition, 
nor are they so constituted that a misunderstanding could be 
exposed by means of any experience. Transcendental reason thus permits 
no touchstone other than its own attempt to bring internal unification 
to its assertions, and this requires a free and unhindered contest 
of these assertions among themselves, which we will now initiate.* 
* The antinomies follow according to the order of the transcendental ideas introduced 
above.

The Antinomy of Pure Reason 
First Conflict of the Transcendental Ideas 54 

Thesis 

The world has a beginning in time, and in space it is also enclosed in 
boundaries. 

Proof 

For if one assumes that the world has no beginning in time, then up to 
every given point in time an eternity has elapsed, and hence an infinite 
series of states of things in the world, each following another, has passed 
away. But now the infinity of a series consists precisely in the fact that 
it can never be completed through a successive synthesis. Therefore an 
infinitely elapsed world-series is impossible, so a beginning of the world 
is a necessary condition of its existence; which was the first point to be 
proved.55 

Regarding the second point, again assume the opposite: then the 
world would be an infinite given whole of simultaneously existing 
things. Now we can think of the magnitude of a quantuma that is not 

A428/ B 456 given as within certain boundaries of every intuition * in no other way 
than by the synthesis of its parts, and we can think of the totality of such 
a quantumb only through the completed synthesis, or through the repeated 
addition of units to each other.t Accordingly, in order to think 

* We can intuit an indeterminate quantum as a whole, if it is enclosed within 
boundaries, without needing to construct its totality through measurement, 
i.e., through the successive synthesis of its parts. For the boundaries already 
determine its completeness by cutting off anything further. 
t The concept of a totality is in this case nothing other than the representation 
of the completed synthesis of its parts, because, since we cannot draw the concept 
from an intuition of the whole (which is impossible in this case), we can 
grasp it, at least in the idea, only through the synthesis of the parts up to their 
completion in the infinite .

The world has no beginning and no bounds in space, but is infinite with 
regard to both time and space. 


Proof 
For suppose that it has a beginning. Since the beginning is an existence 
preceded by a time in which the thing is not, there must be a preceding 
time in which the world was not, i.e., an empty time. But now no arising 
of any sort of thing is possible in an empty time, because no part of 
such a time has, in itself, prior to another part, any distinguishing condition 
of its existence rather than its non-existence (whether one assumes 
that it comes to be of itself or through another cause). Thus 
many series of things may begin in the world, but the world itself cannot 
have any beginning, and so in past time it is infinite. 56 

As to the second point, first assume the opposite, namely that the 
world is finite and bounded in space; then it exists in an empty space, 
which is not bounded. There would thus be encountered not only a relationa 
between things in space, but also a relation of things to space. 
Now since the world is an absolute whole, besides which there is encountered 
no object of intuition, and hence no correlate of the world to A429/ B457 
which the world could stand in relation, the relation of the world to 
empty space would be a relation of the world to no object. Such a relation, 
however, and hence also the boundedness of the world by empty 
space, is nothing; therefore the world is not bounded at all in space, i.e., 
in its extension it is infinite.* 

* Space is merely the form of outer intuition (formal intuition), but not a real A429/ B457 
object that can be outwardly intuited. Space, prior to all things determining 
(filling or bounding) it, or which, rather, give an empirical intuition as to its 
form, is, under the name ofabsolute space,5? nothing other than the mere pos-
Verhaltnis; this will be the only word translated "relation" in Section 2 of the Antinomies 
unless otherwise noted.

the world that fills all space as a whole, the successive synthesis of the 
parts of an infinite world would have to be regarded as completed, i.e., 
in the enumeration of all coexisting things, an infinite time would have 
to be regarded as having elapsed, which is impossible. Accordingly, an 
infinite aggregate of actual things cannot be regarded as a given whole, 
hence cannot be regarded as given simultaneously. Consequently, a 
world is not infinite in its extension in space, but is rather enclosed 
within its boundaries, which was the second point.

1. On the Thesis 
In these mutually conflicting arguments I have not sought semblancesa 
in order to present (as one says) a lawyer's proof, which takes advantage 
of an opponent's carelessness and gladly permits a misunderstanding of 
the law in order to build the case for his own unjust claims on the refutation 
of the other side. Each of these proofs is drawn from the nature 
of the case, and any advantage that could be given to us by the fallacies 
of dogmatists on either side is to be set aside. 


I could also have given a plausibleb proof of the thesis by presupposing 
a defective concept of the infinity of a given magnitude, according 
to the custom of the dogmatists. A magnitude is infinite if none greater 
than it (i.e., greater than the multiplec of a given unit contained in it) is 
possible.58 Now no multiplicity is the greatest, because one or more 
units can always be added to it. Therefore an infinite given magnitude, 
and hence also an infinite world (regarding either the past series or extension), 
is impossible; thus the world is bounded in both respects. I 
could have carried out my proof in this way: only this concept does not 
agree with what is usually understood by an infinite whole. It does not 
represent how great it is, hence this concept is not the concept of a 

A43 2/ B 460 maximum; rather, it thinks only of the relation to an arbitrarily assumed 
unit, in respect of which it is greater than any number. 
According as the unit is assumed to be greater or smaller, this infinity 
would be greater or smaller; yet infinity, since it consists merely in the 
relation to this given unit, would always remain the same, even though 
in this way the absolute magnitude of the whole would obviously not be 
cognized at all, which is not here at issue. 


The true (transcendental) concept of infinity is that the successive 
synthesis of unity in the traversal of a quantum can never be com

II. Remark 
On the Antithesis. 

The proof for the infinity of the world-series and of the sum total of the 
world rests on the fact that in the contrary case an empty time, and 
likewise an empty space, would have to constitute the boundary of the 
world. Now it is not unknown to me that attempts are made to avoid 
this consequence by alleging that a boundary of the world in space and 
time may quite well be possible without having to assume an absolute 
time before the world's beginning or an absolute space spreading beyond 
the real world, which is impossible. I am quite satisfied with the 
last part of this opinion of philosophers of the Leibnizian school. Space 
is merely the form of outer intuition, but not a real object that can be 
externally intuited, and it is not a correlate of appearances, but rather 
the form of appearances themselves. Thus space taken absolutely (simply 
by itself) alone cannot occur as something determining the existence 
of things, because it is not an object at all, but only the form of possible 
objects. Thus things, as appearances, do determine space, i.e., among all 
its possible predicates (magnitude and relation) they make it the case 
that this or that one belongs to reality; but space, as something subsisting 
in itself, cannot conversely determine the reality of things in regard 
to magnitude and shape, because it is nothing real in itself. A space, 

sibility of external appearances, insofar as they either exist in themselves or 
can be further added to given appearances. Thus empirical intuition is not put 
together out of appearances and space (out of perception and empty intuition). 
The one is not to the other a correlate of its synthesis, but rather it is 
only bound up with it in one and the same empirical intuition, as matter and 
its form. If one would posit one of these two elements outside the other (space 
outside of all appearances), then from this there would arise all sorts of empty 
determinations of outer intuition, which, however, are not possible perceptions. 
E.g., the world's movement or rest in infinite empty space59 is a determination 
of the relation of the two to one another that can never be perceived, 
and is therefore the predicate of a mere thought-entity.

pleted." From this it follows with complete certainty that an eternity of 
actual states, each following upon another up to a given point in time 
(the present), cannot have passed away, and so the world must have a 
beginning. 

In regard to the second part of the thesis, the difficulty of a series that 
is infinite and yet elapsed does not arise; for the manifold of an infinitely 
extended world is given simultaneously. Yet in order to think the 
totality of such a multiplicity, where we cannot appeal to boundaries 
which would of themselves constitute this totality in intuition, we have 
to give an account of our concept, since in such a case it cannot go from 
the whole to a determinate multiplicity of parts, but must establish the 
possibility of a whole through the successive synthesis of the parts. Now 
since this synthesis has to constitute a series that is never to be completed, 
one can never think a totality prior to it and thus also through 
it. For in this case the concept of the totality itself is the representation 
of a completed synthesis of the parts, and this completion, hence also 
its concept, is impossible.

but appearances cannot be bounded by an empty space out A43

side themselves. The same also holds for time. Admitting all this, it is 
nevertheless uncontroversial that one surely would have to assume 
these two non-entities, empty space outside the world and empty time 
before it, if one assumes a boundary to the world, whether in space or 
in time. 
For as to the attempt to escape this consequence by saying that if the 
world has boundaries (in time and space) then the infinite emptiness 
would have to determine the existence of things as to their magnitude, 
this consists in thinking surrepjtiously of who knows what intelligible 
world in place of a world of sense, and, instead of a first beginning (an 
existence before which a time of non-existence precedes) one thinks of 
an existence in general that presupposes no other condition in the 
world, rather than the boundary of extension one thinks of the limits 
of the world-whole, and thus one gets time and space out of the way. 
But here we are talking only about the mundus phaenomenon a and its 
magnitude, where one can in no way abstract from the intended conditions 
of sensibility without removing the being itself. The world of 
sense, if it is bounded, necessarily lies in an infinite emptiness. If one 
wants to leave this out, and hence leave out space in general as the a priori 
condition of the possibility of appearances, then the whole world of 
sense is left out. But in our problem this alone is given to us. The 
mundus intelligibilisib is nothing but the concept of a world in general, 
abstracting from all conditions of intuiting it, and in regard to which, 
consequently, no synthetic proposition at all, whether affirmative or 
negative, is possible.c

The Antinomy of Pure Reason 
Second Conflict of the Transcendentalldeas60 

Thesis 

Every composite substance in the world consists of simple parts, and 
nothing exists anywhere except the simple or what is composed of 
simples. 

Proof 

For, assume that composite substances do not consist of simple parts: 
then, if all composition is removed in thought, no composite part, and 
(since there are no simple parts) no simple part, thus nothing at all 
would be left over; consequently, no substance would be given. Thus either 
it is impossible to remove all composition in thought or else after 
its removal something must be left over that subsists without any composition, 
i.e., the simple. In the first case, the composite would once 
again not consist of substances (because with substances composition is 
only a contingent relation,a apart from which, as beings persisting by 

A436/B464 themselves, they must subsist). Now since this case contradicts the presupposition, 
only the second case is left: namely, that what is a substantial 
composite in the world consists of simple parts.6I 
From this it follows immediately that all things in the world are simple 
beings, that composition is only an external state of these beings, 
and that even though we can never put these elementary substances 
completely outside this state of combination and isolate them, reason 
must still think of them as the primary subjects of all composition and 
hence think of them prior to it as simple beings.b

b In the first edition, Kant notes: "In the intellectual, if all division is brought to an end, 
the simple remains. In the sensible it can never be brought to an end. In thoughts, if it 
is cancelled, nothing remains." (E CLXVII, p. 50; 23:40)

The Antinomy of Pure Reason 
Second Conflict of the Transcendental Ideas 

Antithesis 

No composite thing in the world consists of simple parts, and nowhere 
in it does there exist anything simple. 

Proof 

Suppose a composite thing (as substance) consists of simple parts. 
Because every external relation between substances, hence every composition 
of them, is possible only in space, there must exist as many 
parts of space as there are parts of the composite thing occupying it. 
Now space does not consist of simple parts, but of spaces. Thus every 
part of the composite must occupy a space. But the absolutely primary 
parts of the composite are simple. Thus the simple occupies a space. 
Now since everything real that occupies a space contains within itself a 
manifold of elements external to one another, and hence is composite, 
and indeed, as a real composite, it is composed not of accidents (for they 
cannot be external to one another apart from substance), but therefore 
of substances; thus the simple would be a substantial composite, which 
contradicts itself. 

The second proposition of the antithesis, that in the world nothing 
at all exists that is simple, is here supposed to signify only this: The ex-A43 7/ B465 
istence of the absolutely simple cannot be established by any experience 
or perception, whether external or internal, and the absolutely simple is 
thus a mere idea, whose objective reality can never be established in any 
possible experience, and hence in the expositiona of appearances it has 
no application or object. For if we assumed that this transcendental idea 
could find an object in experience, then empirical intuition of some 
such object would have to be recognized, an intuition containing absolutely 
no manifold whose elements are external to one another and 
bound into a unity. Now since there is no inference from our not being 
conscious of <such a manifold to its> complete impossibility in any in-

Remark on the Second Antinomy 

I. On the Thesis 
When I talk about a whole which necessarily consists of simple parts, I 
understand thereby a substantial whole only as a proper composite, i.e., 
as a contingent unity of a manifold that, given as separated (at least in 
thought), is posited in a reciprocal combination and thereby constitutes 
one entity. Properly speaking, one should call space not a c0711positu711o 
but a totU711,b because its parts are possible only in the whole, and not the 
whole through the parts. In any case, it could be called a c0711positu711 idealeC 
but not a c0711positu711 reale. d Yet this is only a subtlety. For since space 
is not a composite of substances (not even of real accidents), if I remove 
all composition from it, then nothing, not even a point, might be left 
over; for a point is possible only as the boundary of a space (hence of a 
composite). Thus space and time do not consist of simple parts. What 
belongs only to the state of a substance, even if it has a magnitude (e.g., 
alteration), does not, therefore, consist of the simple, i.e., a certain degree 
of alteration does not arise through the accumulation of many simple 
alterations. Our inference from the composite to the simple is valid 
only for things subsisting by themselves.' But accidents of a state do not 
subsist by themselves. Thus one can easily ruin the proof for the necessity 
of simples as constituent parts of every substantial composite (and 
thus also the whole thesis), if one extends the proof too far and tries to 
make it valid for all composites without distinction, as has sometimes 
actually happened.

tuition of an object,a but this intuition is definitely required for absolute 
simplicity, it follows that this simplicity cannot be inferred from any 
perception, whatever it might be. Since, therefore, nothing can ever be 
given as an absolutely simple objectb in any possible experience, but the 
world of sense must be regarded as the sum total of all possible experiences, 
nothing simple is given anywhere in it. 

This second proposition of the antithesis goes much further than the 
first, since the first banishes the simple only from the intuition of the 
composite, while the second, on the other hand, does away with the 
simple in the whole of nature; hence also it could not have been proved 
from the concept of a given object of outer intuition (of the composite), 
but only from itsC relation to a possible experience in general. 

II. Remark 
On the Antithesis 
Against this proposition that matter is infinitely divisible, for which the 
ground of proof is merely mathematical, objections have been put forward 
by monadists,62 who already lay themselves open to suspicion by 
the fact that they would not allow even the clearest mathematical proofs 
to count as insights into the constitution of space, insofar as it is in fact 
the formal condition of the possibility of all matter, but would rather regard 
these proofs only as inferences from abstract but arbitraryd concepts 
which could not be relate de to real things. It is as if it were possible 
to think up another kind of intuition than the one given in the original 
intuition of space, and to treat the determinations of space a priori as 
not at the same time applying to what is possible only insofar as it fills 
space. If one listens to them, then besides mathematical points, which 
are simple but are boundaries rather than parts of space, one would 
have to think of physical points too as being not only simple, but as also 
having, as parts of space, the privilege of filling it through their mere 
aggregation. Without repeating here the common and clear refutations 
of this absurdity, of which there are many, just as it is entirely pointless 
to try by merely discursive concepts to rationalizer away the evidence of

the most likely candidate seems to us to be (1), or possibly (2).

Moreover, I am talking here only about the simple insofar as it is nec


essarily given in the composite, so that the latter can be resolved into 

the former as its constituent parts. The proper signification of the word 

A442r/B470 monas (in Leibniz's usage)63 refers only to the simple given immediately 
as simple substance (e.g., in self-consciousness) and not as element 
of the composite, which one could better call the atom. And since 
it is only in regard to composites that I want to prove simple substances, 
as their elements, I could call the antithesis a of the second antinomy 
"transcendental atomistic." But because this word has for some time already 
been used to indicate a special way of explaining corporeal appearances

Section II. The antithetic of pure reason 
mathematics, I will remark only that when philosophy quibbles with 
mathematics, this happens only because it forgets that this question has A44Ir/B469 
to do only with appearances and their conditions. Here, however, it is 
not enough to find the concept of the simple for the pure concept of 
the understanding of the composite, but one must find the intuition 
of the simple for the intuition of the composite (for matter), and this is 
entirely impossible in accordance with the laws of sensibility, hence impossible 
with objects of sense. Thus for a whole made up of substances 
thought through the pure understanding it might very well hold that 
prior to all composition of such substances we must have a simple; but 
this does not hold for a totum substantiale phaenomenon,a which, as empirical 
intuition in space, carries with it the necessary property that no 
part of it is simple, because no part of space is simple. Meanwhile, the 
monadists are subtle enough to try to escape from this difficulty by not 
presupposing space as a condition of the possibility of objects of outer 
intuition (bodies), but rather presupposing these objects and the dynamical 
relation of substances in general as the condition of the possibility 
of space. Now we have a concept of bodies only as appearances, 
but as such they necessarily presuppose space as the condition of the 
possibility of all external appearance; and so this dodge is futile, just as 
it has also been sufficiently blocked above in the Transcendental 
Aesthetic. If they were things in themselves, then the proof of the 
monadists would of course hold. 
The second dialectical assertion has the peculiarity that it has against A443/ B47I 
it a dogmatic assertion that is the only one of all the sophisticalb assertions 
that undertakes to provide visible proof, in an object of experience, 
of the reality of something we have ascribed above merely to 
transcendental ideas, namely the simplicityc of substance: namely, that 
the object of inner sense, the I that thinks, is an absolutely simple substance. 
Without going into this (since it was considered more completely 
above), I will remark only that if something is merely thought as 
an object, without adding any synthetic determination of its intuition 
(as happens in the completely bare representation "I"), then of course 
nothing manifold and no composition can be perceived in such a representation. 
Since, further, the predicates through which I think this 
object are mere intuitions of inner sense, nothing can occur in them 
that could prove a manifold of elements external to one another, and 
hence real composition. Thus self-consciousness is such that because 
the subject that thinks is simultaneously its own object,d it cannot divide

itself (though it can divide the determinations inhering in it); for in regard 
to its own self every object is absolute unity. Nonetheless, if this 
subject is considered externally, as an object of intuition, then it would 
indeed exhibit composition in its own appearance. This is the way in 
which it must be considered, however, if one wants to know whether or 
not there is in it a manifold of elements external to one another.

The Antinomy of Pure Reason 
Third Conflict of the Transcendental Ideas 64 


Thesis 

Causality in accordance with laws of nature is not the only one from 
which all the appearances of the world can be derived. It is also necessary 
to assume another causality through freedom in order to explain them. 

Proof 

Assume that there is no other causality than that in accordance with 
laws of nature: then everything that happens presupposes a previous 
state, upon which it follows without exception according to a rule. But 
now the previous state itself must be something that has happened 
(come to be in a time when it previously was not), since if it had been 
at every time, then its consequence could not have just arisen, but 
would always have been. Thus the causality of the cause through which 
something happens is always something that has happened, which according 
to the law of nature presupposes once again a previous state and 
its causality, and this in the same way a still earlier state, and so on. If, 
therefore, everything happens according to mere laws of nature, then at 

A446/B474 every time there is only a subordinate but never a first beginning, and 
thus no completeness of the series on the side of the causes descending 
one from another. But now the law of nature consists just in this, that 
nothing happens without a cause sufficiently determined a priori. Thus 
the proposition that all causality is possible only in accordance with laws 
of nature, when taken in its unlimited universality, contradicts itself, 
and therefore this causality cannot be assumed to be the only one. 
Accordingly, a causality must be assumed through which something 
happens without its cause being further determined by another previous 
cause, i.e., an absolute causal spontaneity beginning from itselfb 
a series of appearances that runs according to natural laws, hence transcendental 
freedom, without which even in the course of nature the series 
of appearances is never complete on the side of the causes.

There is no freedom, but everything in the world happens solely in accordance 
with laws of nature. 


Proof 
Suppose there were a freedom in the transcendental sense, as a special 
kind of causality in accordance with which the occurrences of the world 
could follow, namely a faculty of absolutely beginning a state, and hence 
also a series of its consequences; then not only will a series begin absolutely 
through this spontaneity, but the detem1ination of this spontaneity 
itself to produce the series, i.e., its causality, will begin absolutely, 
so that nothing precedes it through which this occurring action is determined 
in accordance with constant laws. Every beginning of action, however, 
presupposes a state of the not yet acting cause, and a dynamically 
first beginning of action presupposes a state that has no causal connection 
at all with the cause of the previous one, i.e., in no way follows from 
it. Thus transcendental freedom is contrary to the causal law, and is a 
combination between the successive states of effective causes in accor-A447/B475 
dance with which no unity of experience is possible, which thus cannot 
be encountered in any experience, and hence is an empty thought-entity. 

Thus we have nothing but nature in which we must seek the connection 
and order of occurrences in the world. Freedom (independence) 
from the laws of nature is indeed a liberation from coercion, 
but also from the guidancea of all rules. For one cannot say that in 
place of the laws of nature, laws of freedom enter into the course of the 
world, because if freedom were determined according to laws, it would 
not be freedom, but nothing other than nature.b Thus nature and transcendental 
freedom are as different as lawfulness and lawlessness; the

A448/B476 Remark on the Third Antinomy 

1. On the Thesis 
The transcendental idea of freedom is far from constituting the whole 
content of the psychological concept of that name, which is for the most 
part empirical, but constitutes only that of the absolute spontaneity of 
an action, as the real ground of its imputability; but this idea is nevertheless 
the real stumbling block for philosophy, which finds insuperable 
difficulties in admitting this kind of unconditioned causality. Hence 
that in the question of freedom of the will which has always put speculative 
reason into such embarrassment is really only transcendental, 
and it concerns only whether a faculty of beginning a series of successive 
things or states from itself a is to be assumed. How such a faculty 
is possible is not so necessary to answer, since with causality in accordance 
with natural laws we likewise have to be satisfied with the a priori 
cognition that such a thing must be presupposed, even though we do 
not in any way comprehend how it is possible for one existence to be 
posited through another existence, and must in this case keep solely to 
experience. We have really established this necessity of a first beginning 
of a series of appearances from freedom only to the extent that this is 
required to make comprehensible an origin of the world, since one can 
take all the subsequent states to be a result of mere natural laws. But beA450/
B478 cause the faculty of beginning a series in time entirely on its ownb is 
thereby proved (though no insight into it is achieved), now we are permitted 
also to allow that in the course of the world different series may 
begin on their own as far as their causality is concerned, and to ascribe 
to the substances in those series the faculty of acting from freedom. 
One should not, however, be stopped here by a misunderstanding, 
namely, that since a successive series in the world can have only a comparatively 
first beginning, because a state of the world must always precede 
it, perhaps no absolutely first beginning of the series is possible

Section II. The antithetic of pure reason 
former burdens the understanding with the difficulty of seeking the ancestry 
of occurrences ever higher in the series of causes, because the 
causality in them is at every time conditioned, but it promises in compensation 
a thoroughgoing and lawful unity of experience, while the 
miragea of freedom, on the contrary, though of course offering rest to 
the inquiring understanding in the chain of causes by leading it to an 
unconditioned causality that begins to act from itself, since it is itself 
blind, breaks away from the guidance of those rules by which alone a 
thoroughly connected experience is possible. 
II. Remark A449/B477 
On the Antithesis 
The defender of the omnipotenceb of nature (transcendental physiocracy), 
in counteraction to the doctrine of freedom, would maintain his 
proposition against the sophisticale inferences of the latter, in the following 
way. If you do not assume anything mathematically first in 
the world as far as time is concerned, then it is also not necessary 
for you to seek for something dynamically first as far as causality 
is concerned. Whoever told you to think up an absolutely first state of 
the world, and hence an absolute beginning of the continuously elapsing 
series of appearances, and then, so that your imagination might find 
some point at which to rest, to set a boundary to limitless nature? Since 
the substances in the world have always existed -at least the unity of experience 
makes such a presupposition necessary -there is no difficulty 
in also assuming that the change of their states, i.e., the series of their 
alterations, has always existed, and hence that no first beginning, 
whether mathematical or dynamical, need be sought. The possibility of 
such an infinite descent, without any first member to which the rest is 
merely subsequent, cannot, as to its possibility, be made comprehensible.
d But if you reject this riddle of nature on this account, then you will 
see yourself compelled to dispense with many fundamental properties 
(fundamental powers) which you can just as little comprehend, and even 
the possibility of an alteration in general must become a stumbling 
block for you. For if you did not find through experience that alteration A4SrI / B479 
really exists, then you would never be able to imagine' a priori how such 
an uninterrupted sequence of being and not-being is possible.

during the course of the world. For here we are talking of an absolute 
beginning not, as far as time is concerned, but as far as causality is concerned. 
If (for example) I am now entirely free, and get up from my 
chair without the necessarily determining influence of natural causes, 
then in this occurrence, along with its natural consequences to infinity, 
there begins an absolutely new series, even though as far as time is concerned 
this occurrence is only the continuation of a previous series. For 
this decision and deed do not lie within the succession of merely natural 
effects and are not a mere continuation of them; rather, the determining 
natural causes of that series entirely cease in regard to this 
event, which indeed follows upon that series, but does not follow 
from it;a and therefore it must be called, not as far as time is concerned 
but in regard to causality, an absolutely first beginning of a series of 
appearances. 

The confirmation of the need of reason to appeal to a first beginning 
from freedom in the series of natural causes is clearly and visibly evident 
from the fact that (with the exception of the Epicurean school) all the 
philosophers of antiquity saw themselves as obliged to assume a first 
mover65 for the explanation of motions in the world, i.e., a freely acting 
cause, which began this series of states first and from itself. For they 
did not venture to make a first beginning comprehensible on the basis 
of mere nature.

Moreover, even if a transcendental faculty of freedom is conceded in 
order to begin alterations in the world, then this faculty would in any 
case have to be outside the world (although it always remains a bold 
presumption to assume an object outside the sum total of all possible intuitions, 
which cannot be given in any possible perception). Yet it can 
never be permitted to ascribe such a faculty to substances in the world 
itself, because then the connection of appearances necessarily determining 
one another in accordance with universal laws, which one calls 
nature, and with it the mark of empirical truth, which distinguishes experience 
from dreaming, would largely disappear. For alongside such a 
lawless faculty of freedom, nature could hardly be thought any longer, 
because the laws of the latter would be ceaselessly modified by the former, 
and this would render the play of appearances, which in accordance 
with mere nature would be regular and uniform, confused and 
disconnected.

The Antinomy of Pure Reason 
Fourth Conflict of the Transcendental Ideas 66 


Thesis 

To the world there belongs something that, either as a part of it or as its 
cause, is an absolutely necessary being.a 

Proof 

The world of sense, as the whole of all appearances, at the same time 
contains a series of alterations. For without these, even the temporal 
series, as a condition of the possibility of the world of sense, would not 
be given to us. * Every alteration, however, stands under its condition, 
which precedes it in time, and under which it is necessary. Now every 
conditioned that is given presupposes, in respect of its existence, a 
complete series of conditions up to the unconditioned, which alone is 
absolutely necessary. Thus there must exist something absolutely necessary, 
if an alteration exists as its consequence. This necessary being 
itself, however, belongs to the world of sense. For supposing it is outside 
it, then the series of alterations in the world would derive from it, 
A45􀝛B 482 without this necessary cause itself belonging to the world of sense. 
Now this is impossible. For since the beginning of a time-series can be 
determined only through what precedes it in time, the supreme condition 
of the beginning of a series of changes must exist in the timeb 
when the series was not yet (for the beginning is an existence, preceded 
by a time in which the thing that begins still was not). Thus the causal


A452/B 482 * Time, as formal condition of the possibility of alterations, indeed precedes ite 
objectively, yet subjectively and in the reality of consciousness, this representation 
is given, like any other, only through the occasion of perceptions.

The Antinomy of Pure Reason 
Fourth Conflict of the Transcendental Ideas 


Antithesis 

There is no absolutely necessary being existing anywhere, either in the 
world or outside the world as its cause. 

Proof 

Suppose that either the world itself is a necessary being or that there is 
such a being in it; then in the series of its alterations either there would 
be a beginning that is unconditionally necessary, and hence without a 
cause, which conflicts with the dynamic law of the determination of all 
appearances in time; or else the series itself would be without any beginning, 
and, although contingent and conditioned in all its parts, it 
would nevertheless be absolutely necessary and unconditioned as a 
whole, which contradicts itself, because the existence of a multiplicity 
cannot be necessary if no single part of it possesses an existence necessary 
in itself. 

Suppose, on the contrary, that there were an absolutely necessary 
cause of the world outside the world; then this cause, as the supreme A4SS/B483 
member in the series of causes of alterations in the world, would first 
begin these changes and their series.* But it would have to begin to act 
then, and its causality would belong in time, and for this very reason in 
the sum total of appearances, i.e., in the world; consequently, it itself, 
the cause, would not be outside the world, which contradicts what was 
presupposed. Thus neither in the world nor outside it (yet in causal 
connection with it) is there any absolutely necessary being. 

* The word "begin" is taken in two significations. The first is active, as when 
the cause begins (infit) a series of states as its effect. The second is passive, as 
when the causality in the cause itself commences (fit). I infer here from the 
former to the latter. 
491 

Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. II 

ity of the necessary cause of the alterations, hence the cause itself, belongs 
to time,a hence to appearance (in which alone time is possible, as 
its form); consequently, it cannot be thought as detached from the 
world of sense as the sum total of all appearances. Thus in the world 
itself there is contained something absolutely necessary (whether as 
the whole world-series itself or as a part of it). 


A4S6/B484 Remark on the Fourth Antinomy 

I. On the Thesis 
In order to prove the existence of a necessary being, I am here obliged 
to use no argument except the cosmological one, which ascends from 
the conditioned in appearance to the unconditioned in concept by viewing 
the latter as the necessary condition for the absolute totality of the 
series. It belongs to another principleb of reason to attempt the proof 
using only the idea of a being that is supreme over all others, and such 
a proof will therefore have to be put forward separately. 


Now the pure cosmological proof can establish the existence of a 
necessary being in no other way than by leaving it unsettled whether 
this being is the world itself or a thing distinct from it. For in order to 
ascertain the latter, principles would be required that are no longer cosmological 
and do not continue in the series of appearances, but proceed 
from concepts of contingent beings in general (insofar as they are considered 
merely as objects of understanding), and a principle connecting 
such beings with a necessary being through mere concepts; all this belongs 
to a transcendent philosophy, for which this is still not the place. 

But if one begins the proof cosmologically, by grounding it on the series 
of appearances and the regress in this series in accordance with empirical 
laws of causality, then one cannot later shift from this and go 
over to something that does not belong to the series as one of its members. 
For something regarded as a condition must be taken in just the 
same significance as it has in the relatione of conditioned to its condition 
in the series, if it is to lead this series to its highest condition 
through a continuous progress. Now if this relation is sensible and belongs 
to a possible empirical use of the understanding, then the highest 
condition or cause can conclude the regress only in accordance with 
laws of sensibility, hence only as something belonging to the time-series, 
and the necessary being must be regarded as the supreme member 
of the world-series. 

Nevertheless, some have taken the liberty of making such a shift

II. Remark A457/B485 
On the Antithesis 
If one supposes that difficulties are to be encountered in ascending in 
a series of appearances to the existence of an absolutely necessary cause, 
then these difficulties must not be grounded on the mere concepts of the 
necessary existence of a thing, hence they cannot be merely ontological, 
but must arise from the causal connection with a series of appearances, 
when it tries to assume a condition which is itself unconditioned, thus 
they must be cosmological and based on empirical laws. It must be 
shown, however, that ascent in the series of causes (in the world of sense) 
could never end with an empirically unconditioned condition, and that 
the cosmological argument from the contingency of states of the 
world -from its alterations -comes out against the assumption of a first 
cause that primarily and absolutely initiates the series. 
But an odd contrast shows itself in this antinomy: namely, that the A459/rB487 
same ground of proof from which the thesis of the existence of an original 
being was inferred, is used also in the antithesis to prove its nonexistence, 
and indeed with equal rigor. First it is said There is a 
necessary being because the whole past time includes within itself the 
series of all conditions, and thus with it also the unconditioned (the necessary). 
Then it is said There is no necessary being just because the 
whole of the time that has elapsed includes within itself the series of all 
conditions (which therefore, taken all together, are once again conditioned). 
The cause is this. The first argument looks only to the absolute 
totality of the series of conditions, each determined by another 
in time, and from this it gets something unconditioned and necessary. 
The second argument, on the contrary, takes into consideration the 
contingency of everything determined in the time-series (because before 
each [member] a time must precede, in which its condition must 
once again be determined conditionally), and this completely gets rid of 
everything unconditioned and all absolute necessity. The mode of inA46I/
B489 
ference in both, moreover, is entirely suited to common human reason, 
which falls repeatedly into the trap of disagreeing with itself when it 
considers its object from two different standpoints. M. de Mairan took 
the controversy between two famous astronomers, arising from a similar 
difficulty in the choice of a standpoint, to be a sufficiently strange

Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. II 

(/-LE7cx{3cun<; H,> CXAAO )lEVO'»a. a That is, from the alterations in the world 
they have inferred their empirical contingency, i.e., their dependence 
on empirically determining causes, and thus they obtained an ascending 
series of empirical conditions, which was quite right too. But since they 
could not find in this series a first beginning or a highest member, they 
suddenly abandoned the empirical concept of contingency and took up 
the pure category, which then occasioned a merely intelligible series, 
whose completeness rests on the existence of an absolutely necessary 
cause, which now, since it was no longer bound to sensible conditions, 
was also liberated from the time-condition that even its causality should 
begin. But this proceeding is entirely illegitimate, as one can conclude 
from the following. 


In the pure sense of the category, the contingent is that whose contradictory 
opposite is possible. Now from empirical contingency one 
cannot at all infer this intelligible contingency. When something is al


A46o/ B488 tered, its opposite (the opposite of its state) is actual at another time, 
and hence possible; hence this is not the contradictory opposite of its 
previous state, for which it would be required that at the very time when 
the previous state was, its opposite could have been there in place of it, 
which cannot at all be inferred from the alteration. A body that was in 
motion (= A), comes to be in rest (= not-A). Now from the fact that an 
opposed state follows upon state A it cannot be inferred that the contradictory 
opposite of A is possible, and hence that A is contingent; for 
to have this it would be required that in the very time when there was 
motion, rest could have been there instead. Now we know nothing beyond 
the fact that rest was actual in the time that followed, and hence 
that it was possible too. But motion at one time and rest at another time 
are not contradictory opposites. Thus the succession of opposed determinations, 
i.e., alteration, in no way proves contingency in accordance 
with concepts of the pure understanding, and thus it also cannot lead to 
the existence of a necessary being in accordance with pure concepts of 
the understanding. Alteration proves only empirical contingency, i.e., 
that the new state could not at all have occurred on its own, without a 
cause belonging to the previous time, in accordance with the law of 
causality. This cause, even if it is assumed to be absolutely necessary, 
must yet be of such a kind as to be encountered in time and belong to 
the series of appearances.

The 
Antinomy of Pure Reason 
Third Section 
On the interest of reason in these conflicts. 

Now we have before us the entire dialectical play of the cosmological 
ideas, which do not permit an object congruent to them to be given in 
any possible experience, which, indeed, do not even permit reason to 
think them in agreement with the universal laws of experience, but 
which have not been thought up arbitrarily; reason, rather, in continuous 
progression of the empirical synthesis, has been led to them necessarily 
when it tries to liberate from every condition, and to grasp in its 
unconditioned totality, that which can always be determined only 
conditionally in accordance with rules of experience. These sophistical a 
assertions are only so many attempts to solve four natural and unavoidable 
problems of reason; there can be only so many of them, no more 
and no less, because there are no more series of synthetic presuppositions 
that bound the empirical synthesis a priori. 


We have represented the glittering pretensions of reason to extend its 
territory beyond all the bounds of experience only in dry formulas, 
A463iB491 which contain merely the ground of reason's legal claims; and, as is fitting 
for a transcendental philosophy, we have divested these claims of 
everything empirical, even though the full splendor of reason's assertions 
can shine forth only in such a combination. But in this application, 
and in the progressive extension of the use of reason, since it commences 
with the field of experience and only gradually soars aloft to 
these sublime ideas, philosophy exhibits such a dignity that, if it could 
only assert its pretensions, it would leave every other human science far 
behind in value, since it would promise to ground our greatest expectations 
and prospects concerning the ultimate ends in which all reason's 
efforts must finally unite. The questions whether the world has a beginning 
and its extension in space a boundary; whether there is anywhere, 
perhaps in my thinking self, an indivisible and indestructible 
unity, or whether there is nothing but that which is divisible and perishable; 
whether my actions are free or, like those of other beings, controlled 
by the strings of nature and fate; whether, finally, there is a 
supreme cause of the world, or whether natural things and their order 
constitute the ultimate object, at which all our consideration of things 
must stop -these are questions for whose solution the mathematician 
would gladly give up his entire science; for that science cannot give him 
A464i B492 any satisfaction in regard to the highest and most important ends of humanity. 
Even the proper dignity of mathematics (that pride of human 


a vernunftelnden 

496 



Section III. On the interest of reason in these conflicts 

reason) rests on the fact that since in the great as well as the small, in its 
order and regularity, and in the admirable unity of the forces moving 
nature, mathematics guides reason's insight into nature far beyond 
every expectation of any philosophy built on common experience, it 
gives occasion and encouragement even to the use of reason which extends 
beyond all experience, just as it provides to the philosophy a concerned 
with nature the most excellent materials for supporting its 
inquiries, as far as their characterb allows, with appropriate intuitions. 

Unfortunately for speculation (but perhaps fortunately for the practical 
vocation)C of humanity, reason sees itself, in the midst of its greatest 
expectations, so entangled in a crowd of arguments and counterargumentsd 
that it is not feasible, on account either of its honor or even of 
its security, for reason to withdraw and look upon the quarrel with indifference, 
as mere shadow boxing, still less for it simply to command 
peace, interested as it is in the object of the dispute; so nothing is left except 
to reflect on the origin of this disunity of reason with itself, on 
whether a mere misunderstanding might perhaps be responsible for it, 
after the elucidation of which perhaps both sides will give up their proud A465 / B493 
claims, but in place of which reason would begin a rule of lasting tranquility 
over understanding and sense. 

For now we will postpone this fundamental inquiry a little longer, 
and first take into consideration on which side we would prefer to fight 
if we were forced to take sides. Since in this case we would consult not 
the logical criterion of truth but merely our interest, our present investigation, 
even though it would settle nothing in regard to the disputed e 
rights of both parties, will have the utility of making it comprehensible 
why the participants in this dispute have sooner taken one side than the 
other, even if no superior insight into the object has been the cause of 
it, and it likewise explains still other ancillary things, e.g., the zealous 
heat of the one side and the cold assurance of the other, and why they! 
hail the one party with joyful approval and are irreconcilably prejudiced 
against the other. 


But there is something which, in this provisional estimate, determines 
the standpoint from which it can be carried out with appropriate 
thoroughness, and that is a comparison of the principlesg from which

g Principien

the two parties proceed. In the assertions of the antithesis,a one notes a 
perfect uniformity in their manner of thought and complete unity in 

A466/B494 their maxims, namely a principleb of pure empiricism, not only in the 
explanation of appearances in the world, but also in the dissolution of 
the transcendental ideas of the world-whole itself. Against this the assertions 
of the thesis are grounded not only on empiricism within the 
series of appearances but also on intellectualistic starting points,c and 
their maxim is to that extent not simple. On the basis of their essential 
distinguishing mark, however, I will call them the dogmatism of pure 
reason. 
Thus in determining the cosmological ideas of reason, the side of 
dogmatism or the thesis exhibits: 
First, a certain practical interest, in which every well-disposed person, 
once he understands its true advantage to him, heartily shares. 
That the world has a beginning, that my thinking self is of a simple and 
therefore incorruptible nature, that this self is likewise free and elevated 
above natural compulsion in its voluntary actions, and finally, that the 
whole order of things constituting the world descends from an original 
being, from which it borrows all its unity and purposive connectedness 
-these are so many cornerstones of morality and religion. The 
antithesis robs us of all these supports, or at least seems to rob us of 
them.68 
Second, a speculative interest of reason is expressed on this side 
too. For if one assumes and employs the transcendental ideas in such a 
way, then one can grasp the whole chain of conditions fully a priori and 
comprehend the derivation of the conditioned, starting with the unconditioned, 
which the antithesis cannot do; this gives it a bad recommendation, 
since it can give no answers to questions about the conditions of 
their synthesis that do not leave something out, and with its answers further 
questions without any end are always left over. According to the antithesis, 
one must ascend from a given beginning to a still higher one, 
every part leads to a still smaller part, every event always has another 
event above it as its cause, and the conditions of existence in general are 
always supported again by others, without ever getting stability and support 
from a self-sufficient thing as an unconditioned original being. 
Third, this side also has the merit of popularity, which certainly 
constitutes no small part of what recommends it. The common under

(Intellektualphilosophen, Intellektuellen). 

498 



Section III. On the interest of reason in these conflicts 
standing does not find the least difficulty in the idea of an unconditioned 
beginning for every synthesis, since in any case it is more accustomed 
to descending to consequences than to ascending to grounds; 
and in the concept of something absolutely first (about whose possibility 
it does not bother itself) it finds both comfort and simultaneously a 
firm point to which it may attach the reins guiding its steps, since otherwise, 
always having one foot in the air, it can never take any delight 
in the restless climb from the conditioned to the condition. 
On the side of empiricism in determination of the cosmological A468/B496 
ideas, or the antithesis, there is first, no such practical interest from 
pure principles a of reason as morality and religion carry with them. 
Mere empiricism seems rather to take all power and influence away 
from both. If there is no original being different from the world, if the 
world is without a beginning and also without an author, if our will is 
not free and our soul is of the same divisibility and corruptibility as matter, 
then moral ideas and principles lose all validity, and they collapse 
along with the transcendental ideas that constitute their theoretical 
support. 
On the contrary, however, empiricism offers advantages to the speculative 
interests of reason, which are very attractive and far surpass any 
that the dogmatic teacher of the ideas of reason might promise. For 
with empiricism the understanding is at every time on its own proper 
ground, namely the field solely of possible experiences, whose laws it 
traces, and by means of which it can endlessly extend its secure and 
comprehensibleb cognition. Here it can and should exhibit its object, in 
itself as well as in its relations, to intuition, or at least in concepts an 
image for which can be clearly and distinctly laid before it in similar 
given intuitions. Not only is it unnecessary for the understanding to 
abandon this chain of natural order so as to hang onto ideas with whose A469/B497 
objects it has no acquaintance because, as thought-entities, they can 
never be given; but it is not even permitted to abandon its business, and, 
under the pretext that this has been brought to an end, to pass over into 
the territory of idealizing reason and transcendent concepts, where 
there is no further need to make observations and to inquire according 
to the laws of nature, but rather only to think and invent, certain that 
it can never be refuted by facts of nature because it is not bound by their 
testimony but may go right past them, or even subordinate them to a 
higher viewpoint, namely that of pure reason. 
Hence the empiricist will never allow any epoch of nature to be assumed 
to be the absolutely first, or any boundary of his prospect to be

regarded as the uttermost in its extent, ora that among the objects of 
nature that he can resolve through observation and mathematics and 
determine synthetically in intuition (the extended) there can be a transition 
to those which can never be exhibited in concreto either in sense 
or imagination (the simple); nor will he admit that one can take as fundamental 
in nature itself, a faculty (freedom) that operates independently 
of the laws of nature, and thereby restrict the business of the 
understanding, which is to trace the origin of appearances guided by 
necessary rules; nor, finally, will he concede that the cause of anything 
should be sought outside nature (an original being), for we are acquainted 
with nothing beyond nature, since it is nature alone that provides 
us with objects and instructs us as to their laws. 

Of course, if the empirical philosopher with his antithesis had no 
other intention than to strike down the impertinent curiosity and presumptuousness 
of those who so far mistake the true vocationb of reason 
that they make most of insight and knowledge just where insight and 
knowledge really cease, trying to pass off what one should base on practical 
interests as furthering speculative interests, in order, whenever 
seems comfortable to them, to break off the thread of their physical investigations 
and, with a pretense of extending cognition, to attach it to 
transcendental ideas, by means of which one really knowsc only that 
one knows d nothing; if, I say, the empiricist were to content himself 
with this, then his principle would be a maxim for moderating our 
claims, for being modest in our assertions, and at the same time for the 
greatest possible extension of our understanding through the teacher 
really prescribed for us, namely experience. For in such a case, intellectual 
presuppositions and faith on behalf of our practical concern 
would not be taken from us; only one could not put them forward with 
the title and pomp of science and rational insight, because real speculative 
knowledge can encounter no object anywhere except that of experience, 
and if one transgresses its boundary, then the synthesis that 
attempts cognitions which are new and independent of experience has 
no substratum of intuition on which it could be exercised. 

But if empiricism itself becomes dogmatic in regard to the ideas (as 
frequently happens), and boldly denies whatever lies beyond the sphere 
of its intuitive cognitions, then it itself makes the same mistake of immodesty, 
which is all the more blamable' here, because it causes an irreparable 
disadvantage to the practical interests of reason.

planations of natural appearances, and to neglect the physical investiga


tion of them. 
Finally, as to the third moment that can be seen in the provisional 
choice between the two conflicting parties, it is exceedingly strange that 
empiricism is completely contrary to everything popular, although one 
might have thought that the common understanding would eagerly take 
up a proposal promising to satisfy it through nothing but cognitions of 
experience and their rational connection, in place of transcendental 
dogmatism, which compels it to ascend to concepts far surpassing the 
insight and rational faculties even of those minds most practiced in 
thinking. But just this is its motive. For then it finds itself in a state in A473/B501 
which even the most learned can take nothing away from it. If it understands 
little or nothing of these matters, neither can anyone else 
boast that they understand much more; and even if it cannot speak 
about them with as much scholastic correctness as others do, it can still 
ratiocinateb infinitely more about them, because it is wandering among 

* There is still a question, however, whether Epicurus ever presented these A47IiB499 
principles as objective assertions. If they were perhaps nothing more than 
maxims of the speculative employment of reason, then in them he would have 
shown as genuine a philosophical spirit as any of the sages' of antiquity.d That 
in the explanation of appearances one must go to work as though the field of 
investigation were not cut off by any boundary or beginning of the world; that 
one must assume the material of the world as it has to be if we are to be taught 
about it by experience; that no other way of generating occurrences than their 
determination through unalterable namraltlaws, and finally that no cause distinct 
from the world are to be employed: even now these are principles, very A4721B500 
correct but little observed, for extending speculative philosophy while finding 
out the principles' of morality independently of alien sources; if only those 
who demand that we ignore those dogmatic propositions, as long as we are 
concerned with mere speculation, might not also be accused of trying to deny 
them.

merea ideas, about which one can be at one's most eloquent just because 
one knows nothing about them; whereas regarding inquiries into nature, 
it would have to keep quiet and concede that it is ignorant. 
Comfort and vanity are therefore already a strong recommendation for 
these principles. Besides, even though for a philosopher it is very difficult 
to assume something as a principle without being able to give an 
account of it, or even to assume concepts into whose objective reality 
there can be no insight, there is nothing more usual for the common 
understanding. It wants to have something from which it can proceed 
with confidence. The difficulty of comprehending such a presupposition 
itself does not disturb it, because (in the case of one who does not 
know what it means to comprehend) this never crosses its mind, and it 
takes as known what has become familiar to it through repeated usage. 
Finally, for the common understanding every speculative interest vanishes 
before practical interest, and it imagines itself to have insight and 
B 502 knowledge into whatever its apprehensions or hopes impel it to assume 


A474 or believe. In this way empiricism is robbed completely of all popularity 
by transcendentally idealizing reason; and for all the disadvantages 
itb may contain regarding the supreme practical principles, we need 
have no apprehension that it will ever pass beyond the boundary of the 
schools, and acquire any considerable regard in the community or any 
favor among the great multitude. 
Human reason is by nature architectonic, i.e., it considers all cogni



tions as belonging to a possible system, and hence it permits only such 
principlesc as at least do not render an intended cognition incapable of 
standing together with others in some system or other. But the propositions 
of the antithesis are of a kind that they do render the completion 
of an edifice of cognitions entirely impossible. According to them, beyond 
every state of the world there is another still older one; within 
every part there are always still more that are divisible; before every occurrence 
there was always another which was in turn generated by others; 
and in existence in general everything is always only conditioned, 
and no unconditioned or first existence is to be recognized. Thus since 
the antithesis nowhere allows a first or a starting point that would serve 
absolutely as the foundation for its building, a completed edifice of cognition 
on such presuppositions is entirely impossible. Hence the architectonic 
interest of reason (which is demanded not by empirical unity 
but by pure rational unity) carries with it a natural recommendation for 
the assertions of the thesis.

But if a human being could renounce all interests, and, indifferent to 
all consequences, consider the assertions of reason merely according to 
their grounds, then, supposing that he knows no way of escaping from 
the dilemma a except by confessing allegiance to one or the other of the 
conflicting doctrines, such a person would be in a state of ceaseless vacillation. 
Today it would strike him as convincing that the human will is

he would side with the view that freedom is nothing but self-deception,

The transcendental problems of pure reason, 


they absolutely must be capable of a solution. 

Wanting to solve all problems and answer all questions would be impudent 
boasting and such extravagant self-conceit that one would instantly 
forfeit all trust. Nevertheless, there are sciences whose nature entails 
that every question occurring in them must absolutely be answerable 
from what one knows, because the answer must arise from the same 
source as the question; and there it is in no way allowed to plead unavoidable 
ignorance, but rather a solution can be demanded. One must 
be able to know what is just or unjust in all possible cases in accordance 
with a rule, because our obligations are at stake, and we cannot have any 
obligation to do what we cannot know/ In the explanation of the ap

it could be inferred from this." (E CLXIX, p. 50; 23:40)

A477/B 505 pearances of nature, however, much must remain uncertain and many 
questions insoluble, because what we know about nature is in many 
cases far from sufficient for what we would explain. The question now 
is whether there is any question in transcendental philosophy dealing 
with an objecta placed before us by reason that is unanswerable by this 
same pure reason, and whether one could have a right to avoid answering 
it decisively because one counts as absolutely uncertain (on the basis 
of what we can knowl that of which we have enough of a concept of it 
to be able to raise a question about it, but are so entirely lacking in 
means or faculties that we can never give the answer. 
Now I assert that among all speculative cognition, transcendental 
philosophy has the special property that there is no question at all dealing 
with an object given by pure reason that is insoluble by this very 
same human reason; and that no plea of unavoidable ignorance and the 
unfathomable depth of the problem can release us from the obligation 
of answering it thoroughlyr and completely; for the very same concept 
that puts us in a position to ask the question must also make us competent 
to answer it, since the object is not encountered at all outside the 
concept (as it is in the case of justice and injustice). 
In transcendental philosophy, however, there are no questions other 
than the cosmological ones in regard to which one can rightfully demand 
a sufficient answer concerning the constitution of the object itself; 
the philosopher is not allowed to evade them by pleading their impenetrable 
obscurity, and these questions can have to do only with cosmological 
ideas. For the object must be given empirically, and the question 
concerns only its conformity with an idea. If the object is transcendental 
and thus in itself unknown, e.g., whether the something whose appearance 
(in ourselves) is thinking (the soul) is in itself a simple being, 
whether there is a cause of all things taken together that is absolutely 
necessary, etc., then we should seek an object for our idea, which we can 
concede to be unknown to us, but not on that account impossible.* The 

* To the question, "What kind of constitution does a transcendental object have?" 
one cannot indeed give an answer saying what it is, but one can answer that 
the question itself is nothing, because no object for the question is given. 
Hence all questions of the transcendental doctrine of the soul are answerable 
and actually answered; for they have to do with the transcendental subject of 
all inner appearances, which is not itself an appearance and hence is not given 
as an object, and regarding which none of the categories (at which the question 
A479/ B 507 is really being aimed) encounter conditions of their application. Thus here is a 
case where the common saying holds, that no answer is an answer, namely that

Section IV. On the transcendental problems of pure reason 
cosmological ideas alone have the peculiarity that they can presuppose A479/B507 
their object, and the empirical synthesis required for its concept, as 
given; and the question that arises from them has to do only with the 
progression of this synthesis, insofar as it is to contain an absolute totality, 
which, however, is no longer empirical, since it cannot be given in 
any experience. Now since we are here talking about a thing only as an 
object of a possible experience and not as a thing in itself, the answer to 
the transcendent cosmological question cannot lie anywhere outside the 
idea, for it does not have to do with any object in itself; and in regard to 
possible experience, the question asks not about what can be given in 
concreto in any experience, but rather about what lies in the idea which 
the empirical synthesis is merely supposed to approximate: therefore, 
this question must be able to be resolved from the idea alone; for this 
idea is merely a creature of reason, which therefore cannot refuse the responsibility 
and pass it on to the unknown object. 
It is not as extraordinary as it initially seems that a science can deA480/ 
B 508 
mand and expect clear and certain solutions to all the questions belonging 
within ita (quaestiones domesticae), even if up to this time they 
still have not been found. Besides transcendental philosophy, there are 
two pure sciences of reason, one with merely speculative, the other with 
practical content: pure mathematics and pure morals. Has it ever 
been proposed that because of our necessary ignorance of conditions it 
is uncertain exactly what relation, in rational or irrational numbers, the 
diameter of a circle bears to its circumference? Since it cannot be given 
congruently to the former, but has not yet been found through the latter, 
it has been judged that at least the impossibility of such a solution 
can be known b with certainty, and Lambert gave a proof of this. 70 In the 
universal principlesc of ethics nothing can be uncertain, because the 
propositions are either totally nugatory and empty, or else they have to 
flow merely from our concepts of reason. On the other hand, in natural 
scienced there are an infinity of conjectures in regard to which certainty 
can never be expected, because natural appearances are objects that are 
given to us independently of our concepts, to which, therefore, the key 
lies not in us and in our pure thinking, but outside us, and for this reason 
in many cases it is not found; hence no certain account of these A48 1/ B 509 
a question about the constitution of this something, which cannot be thought 
through any determinate predicate because it is posited entirely outside the 
sphere of objects that can be given to us, is entirely nugatory and empty.

matters can be expected. I do not include the questions of the transcendental 
analytic here, because now we are dealing only with the certainty 
of judgments in regard to objects, and not in regard to the origin 
of Our concepts themselves. 

Thus we cannot evade the obligation of giving at least a critical resolution 
of the questions of reason before us by lamenting the narrow 
limits of our reason and confessing, with the appearance of a modest 
self-knowledge,a that it lies beyond our reason to settle whether the 
world has existed from eternity or has a beginning, whether worldspace 
is filled to infinity with beings or is enclosed within certain 
boundaries, whether there is anything simple in the world or everything 
has to be divided infinitely, whether there is a generating and producing 
through freedom Or everything depends on the causal chain of the 
natural order, and finally, whether there is any being entirely unconditioned 
and in itself necessary or whether the existence of everything is 
conditioned and hence externally dependent and in itself contingent. 
For each of these questions concerns an object that can be given 
nowhere but in our thoughts, namely the absolutely unconditioned totality 
of the synthesis of appearances. If we cannot say or settle anything 

A482 / B 510 certain about these questions on the basis of our own concepts, then we 
must not pass the blame on to the subject matter,b as hiding itself from 
us; for such a subject matter (because it is encountered nowhere outside 
our idea) cannot be given to us at all, but rather we must seek the cause 
in our idea itself, as a problem permitting of no solution, about which, 
however, we stubbornly insist on an actual object corresponding to it. A 
clear presentation of the dialectic lying in our concept itself would soon 
bring us to complete certainty about what we have to judge in regard to 
such a question. 
In response to your objection that these problems are uncertain one 
can counterpose this question, to which, at least, you must give a clear 
answer: Where do you get the ideas the solution to which involves you 
in such difficulties? Is it perhaps appearances, whose explanation you 
need here, and about which, owing to these ideas, you have to seek only 
the principlesc or the rule of their exposition? Assume that nature were 
completely exposed to you; that nothing were hidden from your senses 
and to the consciousness of everything laid before your intuition: even 
then you still could not, through any experience, cognize in concreto the 
object of your ideas (for besides this complete intuition, a completed 
B 5I I synthesis and the consciousness of its absolute totality would be re

quired, but that is not possible through any empirical cognition); hence 
your question cannot in any way be necessarily poseda in the course of 
explaining any experience that might come before you, and thus posed, 
as it were, through the object itself. For the object can never come before 
you, because it cannot be given in any possible experience. With all 
possible perceptions, you always remain caught up among conditions, 
whether in space or in time, and you never get to the unconditioned, so 
as to make out whether this unconditioned is to be posited in an absolute 
beginning of the synthesis or in the absolute totality of the series 
without a beginning. The whole,h in an empirical signification, is always 
only comparative. The absolute whole of magnitude (the world-whole), 
of division, of descent, of the conditions of existence in general, together 
with all the questions about whether these are to come about 
through a finite or an endlessly continuing synthesis, has nothing to do 
with any possible experience. For example, you will not be able to explain 
the appearance of a body the least bit better, or even any differently, 
whether you assume that it consists of simple parts or completely 
of parts that are always composite; for no simple appearance can come 
before you, and neither can any infinite composition. Appearances require 
to be explained only insofar as their conditions of explanation are 
given in perception, but everything that can ever be given in it, taken 
together in an absolute whole,c is not itself any perception.d But it is 
really this whole' for which an explanation is being demanded in the 
transcendental problems of reason. 

Since, therefore, the solution to these problems can never occur in experience, 
you cannot say that it is uncertain what is to be ascribed to the 
object regarding them. For your object is merely in your brain! and cannot 
be given at all outside it; hence all you have to worry about is agreeing 
with yourself, and avoiding the amphiboly that would make your 
idea into a putative representation of something given empirically, and 
thus of an objectg to be cognized in accordance with the laws of experience. 
Thus the dogmatic solution is not merely uncertain, but impossible. 
The critical solution, however, which can be completely certain, 
does not consider the question objectively at all, but instead asks about 
the foundations of the cognition in which it is grounded.

The 
Antinomy of Pure Reason 
Section Five 
Skeptical representation of the cosmological questions 
raised by all four transcendental ideas. 

We would gladly refrain from demanding to see our questions answered 
dogmatically if we comprehended right from the start that however the 
answer might come out, it would only increase our ignorance, removing 
one inconceivability only to replace it with another, taking us out of 
one obscurity only to plunge us into a still greater one, and perhaps 
even into contradictions. If our question is put merely in terms of affirmation 
or negation, then it is prudent to handle it by initially leaving 
aside the supposed grounds for each side and first taking into account 
what one would gain if the answer turned out on one side or on the opposite 
side. Now if it so happened that the result in both cases was 
something quite empty of sense (nonsense),a then we would have good 
grounds to summon our question itself to be critically examined and to 
see whether it does not itself rest on a groundless presupposition and 
play with an idea that better betrays its falsity in its application and consequences 
than in its abstract representation. This is the great utility of 

A486/B 514 the skeptical way of treating the questions that pure reason puts to pure 
reason; by means of it one can with little expense exempt oneself from 
a great deal of dogmatic rubbish, and put in its place a sober critique, 
which, as a true cathartic, will happily purge such delusions along with 
the punditryb attendant on them. 
Accordingly, if! could antecedently see about a cosmological idea that 
whatever side of the unconditioned in the regressive synthesis of appearances 
it might come down on, it would be either too big or too small 
for every concept of the understanding, then I would comprehend 
that since it has to do with an object of experience,?' which should conform 
to a possible concept of the understanding, this idea must be entirely 
empty and without significance because the object does not fit it 
no matter how I may accommodate the one to the other. And this is actually 
the case with all the world-concepts, which is why reason, as long 
as it holds to them, is involved in an unavoidable antinomy. For assume: 
First, that the world has no beginning; then it is too big for your 
concept; for this concept, which consists in a successive regress, can 
never reach the whole eternity that has elapsed. Suppose it has a beginning, 
then once again it is too small for your concept of under


A487/ B 5 I 5 standing in the necessary empirical regress. For since the beginning 

a lauter Sinnleeres (Nonsens) 
b Vielwisserei 


508 



Section V Skeptical representation of all cosmological questions 

always presupposes a preceding time, it is still not unconditioned, and 
the law of the empirical use of the understanding obliges you to ask for 
a still higher temporal condition, and the world is obviously too small 
for this law. 

It is exactly the same with the two answers to the question about the 
magnitude of the world in space. For if it is infinite and unbounded, 
then it is too big for every possible empirical concept. If it is finite and 
bounded, then you can still rightfully ask: What determines this boundary? 
Empty space is not a correlate of things that subsists by itself, and 
it cannot be a condition with which you can stop, still less an empirical 
condition that constitutes a part of a possible experience. (For who can 
have an experience of what is absolutely empty?) But for the absolute 
totality of the empirical synthesis it is always demanded that the unconditioned 
be an empirical concept. Thus a bounded world is too 
small for your concept. 

Second, if every appearance in space (matter) consists of infinitely 
many parts, then the regress of division is always too big for your concept; 
and if the division of space should cease at anyrone member of 
the division (the simple), then it is too small for the idea of the unconditioned. 
For this member always allows of still another regress to further 
parts contained in it. 

Third, if you assume that in everything that happens in the world 
there is nothing but a sequence occurring according to laws of nature, 
then the causality of the cause is always once again something that happens, 
and that necessitates your regress to still higher causes, and hence 
the prolonging of the series of conditions a parte priori without cessation. 
Mere efficient a nature in the synthesis of world-events is thus too 
big for all your concepts. 

If you choose now and then to admit occurrences produced from 
themselves, hence generated through freedom, then by an unavoidable 
law of nature the question "Why?" will pursue you, and require 
you, in accord with the causal laws of experience, to go beyond this 
point; then you will find that such a totality of connection is too small 
for your necessary empirical concept. 

Fourth: If you assume an absolutely necessary being (whether it be 
the world itself, or something in the world, or the cause of the world), 
then you must place it at a time infinitely far removed from every given 
point in time, because otherwise it would be dependent on another and 
an older existence. But then this existence is inaccessible and too big for 
your empirical concept, and you could never arrive at it through any 
regress, however far it might continue. 

But if, in your opinion, everything that belongs to the world 

a wirkende 


509 



Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. II 

(whether as conditioned or as condition) is contingent, then every existence 
given to you is too small for your concept. For this existence 
compels you to look around for yet another existence on which this 
one is dependent. 

In all these cases, we have said that the world-idea is either too big 
for the empirical regress, hence for every possible concept of the understanding, 
or else too small for it. But why haven't we expressed ourselves 
in just the opposite way, and said that in the first case the 
empirical concept is always too small for the idea, and in the second too 
big for it -thus, as it were, holding the empirical regress responsible? 
Why have we instead accused the cosmological idea of falling short or 
exceeding its end, namely possible experience? The reason was this. It 
is possible experience alone that can give our concepts reality; without 
it, every concept is only an idea, without truth and reference to an object. 
Hence the possible empirical concept was the standard by which it 
had to be judged whether the idea is a mere idea and a thought-entitya 
or instead encounters its object within the world. For one says that one 
thing is too great or too small relative to another only when the former 
thing is assumed to exist for the sake of the latter, and hence has to be 
adapted to it. Among the conundrumsb of the ancient dialectical schools 

A490/B 518 was this question: If a ball does not pass through a hole, should one say 
that the ball is too big, or that the hole is too small? In this case, it is indifferent 
how you choose to express yourself; for you do not know 
which of the two is there for the sake of the other. By contrast, you will 
not say that the man is too tall for his clothing, but rather that the clothing 
is too short for the man. 
Thus we have been brought at least to the well-grounded suspicion 
that the cosmological ideas, and all the sophistical assertions about 
them that have come into conflict with one another, are perhaps 
grounded on an empty and merely imagined concept of the way the object 
of these ideas is given to us; and this suspicion may already have put 
us on the right track for exposing the semblance that has so long misled 
us. C

In his copy of the first edition, Kant writes: "In the cosmological ideas, the first two 
propositions say too much for the opposition, the last two too little. The former say: 
'Everything is either eternal in time or has a beginning,' while they should have said: 'or 
it is not eternal and exists as thing in itself in no time at all.' 

"In the latter too little is said. Hence both can be true: e.g., everything in the 
world is either dependent or independent (everything necessary). The former is true 
of phenomena, the latter of noumena outside the world." (E CLXX, pp. -50-1;

Section VI. Key to the solution of the cosmological dialectic 

The 
Antinomy of Pure Reason 
Section Six 
Transcendental idealism as the key to solving 
the cosmological dialectic. 


We have sufficiently proved in the Transcendental Aesthetic that everything 
intuited in space or in time, hence all objects of an experience 
possible for us, are nothing but appearances, i.e., mere representations, A491/ B 519 
which, as they are represented, as extended beings or series of alterations, 
have outside our thoughts no existence grounded in itself. This 
doctrine I call transcendental idealism. * The realist, in the transcendental 
signification, makes these modifications of our sensibility into 
things subsisting in themselves, and hence makes mere representations 
into things in themselves. 

One would do us an injustice if one tried to ascribe to us that longdecried 
empirical idealism that, while assuming the proper reality of 
space, denies the existence of extended beings in it, or at least finds this 
existence doubtful, and so in this respect admits no satisfactorily provable 
distinction between dream and truth. As to the appearances of 
inner sense in time, it finds no difficulty in them as real things; indeed, 
it even asserts that this inner experience and it alone gives sufficient 
proof of the real existence of their objectb (in itself) along with all this 
time-determination. 

Our transcendental idealism, on the contrary, allows that the objects B 520 
of outer intuition are real too, just as they are intuited in space, along 
with all alterations in time, just as inner sense represents them. For 
since space is already a form of that intuition that we call outer, and 
without objects in it there would be no empirical representation at all, A492 
we can and must assume extended beings in space as real; and it is precisely 
the same with time. Space itself, however, together with time, 
and, with both, all appearances, are not things, but rather nothing but 
representations, and they cannot exist at all outside our mind; and even 
the inner and sensible intuition of our mind (as an object of conscious

from material idealism, i.e., the common idealism that itself doubts or de-B 519

to employ this rather than the expression given above, in order to avoid all 
misinterpretation.>'

ness), the determination of which through the succession of different 
states is representeda in time, is not the real self as it exists in itself, or 
the transcendental subject, but only an appearance of this to us unknown 
being, which was given to sensibility. The existence of this inner 
appearance, as a thing thus existing in itself, cannot be admitted, because 
its condition is time, which cannot be a determination of any 
thing in itself. In space and time, however, the empirical truth of appearances 
is satisfactorily secured, and sufficiently distinguished from 

B 52 I its kinship with dreams, if both are correctly and thoroughly connected 
up according to empirical laws in one experience. 
Accordingly, the objects of experience are never given in themselves, 
but only in experience, and they do not exist at all outside it. 

A493 That there could be inhabitants of the moon, even though no human 
being has ever perceived them, must of course be admitted; but this 
meansb only that in the possible progress of experience we could encounter 
them; for everything is actual that stands in one context with a 
perception in accordance with the laws of the empirical progression. 
Thus they are real when they stand in an empirical connection with my 
real consciousness, although they are not therefore real in themselves, 
i.e., outside this progress of experience. 
Nothing is really given to us except perception and the empirical 
progress from this perception to other possible perceptions. For in 
themselves, appearances, as mere representations, are real only in perception, 
which in fact is nothing but the reality of an empirical representation, 
i.e., appearance. To call an appearance a real thing prior to 
perception means[ either that in the continuation of experience we must 
encounter such a perception, or it has no meaningd at all. For that it 
should exist in itself without relation to our senses and possible experi-

B 522 ence, could of course be said if we were talking about a thing in itself. 
But what we are talking about is merely an appearance in space and time, 
neither of which is a determination of things in themselves, but only of 
our sensibility; hence what is in them (appearances) are not something 

A494 in itself, but mere representations, which if they are not given in us (in 
perception) are encountered nowhere at all. 
The sensible faculty of intuition is really only a receptivity for being 
affected in a certain way with representations, whose relation to one another 
is a pure intuition of space and time (pure forms of our sensibility), 
which, insofar as they are connected and determinable in these

relationsa (in space and time) according to laws of the unity of experience, 
are called objects. The non-sensible cause of these representations 
is entirely unknown to us, and therefore we cannot intuit it as an 
object;b for such an object would have to be represented neither in 
space nor in time (as mere conditions of our sensible representation), 
without which conditions we cannot think any intuition. Meanwhile we 
can call the merely intelligible cause of appearances in general the transcendental 
object,' merely so that we may have something corresponding 
to sensibility as a receptivity. To this transcendental objectd we can 
ascribe the whole extent and connection of our possible perceptions, B 52 3 
and say that it is given in itself prior to all experience. But appearances 
are, in accordance with it, given not in themselves but only in this experience, 
because they are mere representations, which signify a real 
object only as perceptions, namely when this perception connects up A495 
with all others in accordance with the rules of the unity of experience. 
Thus one can say: The real things of past time are given in the transcendental 
object of experience, but for me they are objects and real in 
past time only insofar as I represent to myself that, in accordance with 
empirical laws, or in other words, the course of the world, a regressive 
series of possible perceptions (whether under the guidance of history or 
in the footsteps of causes and effects) leads to a time-series that has 
elapsed as the condition of the present time, which is then represented 
as real only in connection with a possible experience and not in itself; 
so that all those events which have elapsed from an inconceivable past 
time prior to my own existence signify nothing but the possibility of 
prolonging the chain of experience, starting with the present perception, 
upward to the conditions that determine it in time. 

If, accordingly, I represent all together all existing objects of sense in 
all time and all spaces, I do not posit them as being there in space and 
time prior to experience, but rather this representation is nothing other B 524 
than the thought of a possible experience in its absolute completeness. 
In it alone are those objects (which are nothing but mere representations) 
given. But to say that they exist prior to all my experience meanse A496 
only that they are to be encountered in the part of experience to which 
I, starting with the perception, must first of all progress. The cause of 
the empirical conditions of this progress, the cause, therefore, of which 
members of it I might encounter, and also the extent to which I may encounter 
them in the regress, is transcendental, and hence necessarily

unknown to me. We, however, have nothing to do with that, but only 
with the rule of the progress of experience, in which objects, namely appearances, 
are given. It is all the same to the outcome whether I say that 
in the empirical progress in space I could encounter stars that are a hundred 
times farther from me than the most distant ones I see, or whether 
I say that perhaps they are there to be encountered in world-space even 
if no human being has ever perceived them or ever will perceive them; 
for if they were given as things in themselves, without any reference to 
possible experience at all, then they would be nothing for me, hence 
they would not be objects contained in the series of the empirical 
regress. Only in another relation, when these same appearances are to 
B 525 be used on behalf of the cosmological idea of an absolute whole and 
having to do with a question that goes beyond the bounds of possible 
experience, is it important to distinguish between the ways one might 
take the reality of objects of sense when thinking them, so as to prevent 

A497 a deceptive delusion that must inevitably arise if we misinterpret our 
own concepts of experience. 


The 
Antinomy of Pure Reason 
Section Seven 
Critical decision of the cosmological conflict of reason 
with itself. 

The entire antinomy of pure reason rests on this dialectical argument: 
If the conditioned is given, then the whole series of all conditions for it 
is also given; now objects of the senses are given as conditioned; consequently, 
etc. Through this syllogism, whose major premise seems so 
natural and evident, a corresponding number of cosmological ideas are 
introduced, in accordance with the difference of the conditions (in the 
synthesis of appearances), insofar as they constitute a series, which postulate 
an absolute totality of these series and thereby put reason into an 
unavoidable conflict with itself. But before we expose what is deceptive 
about this sophistical argument, we have to put in place certain of the 
concepts occurring in it, by correcting and determining them. 

First, the following proposition is clear and undoubtedly certain: If 
the conditioned is given, then through it a regress in the series of all 
conditions for it is given to us as a problem;a for the concept of the 
conditioned already entails that something is related to a condition, and 
if this condition is once again conditioned, to a more remote condition, 
and so through all the members of the series. This proposition is therefore 
analytic and beyond any fear of a transcendental criticism. It is a 

auns ...lIufgegeben sei 


B 526 
A498 
514 



Section VII. Critical decision of the cosmological conflict 

logical postulate of reason to follow that connection of a concept with 
its conditions through the understanding, and to continue it as far as 
possible, which already attaches to the concept itself. 

Further: If the conditioned as well as its condition are things in themselves, 
then when the first is given not only is the regress to the second 
given as a problem, but the latter is thereby really already given along 
with it; and, because this holds for all members of the series, then the 
complete series of conditions, and hence the unconditioned is thereby 
simultaneously given, or rather it is presupposed by the fact that the conditioned, 
which is possible only through that series, is given. Here the 
synthesis of the conditioned with its conditions is a synthesis of the mere 
understanding, which represents things as they are without paying attention 
to whether and how we might achieve acquaintance a with them. B 527 
On the contrary, if I am dealing with appearances, which as mere representations 
are not given at all if! do not achieve acquaintance with them 

(i.e. to them themselves, for they are nothing except empirical cogni-A499 
tions),b then I cannot say with the same meaningC that if the conditioned 
is given, then all the conditions (as appearances) for it are also given; and 
hence I can by no means infer the absolute totality of the series of these 
conditions. For the appearances, in their apprehension, are themselves 
nothing other than an empirical synthesis (in space and time) and thus 
are given only in this synthesis. Now it does not follow at all that if the 
conditioned (in appearance) is given, then the synthesis constituting its 
empirical condition is thereby also given too and presupposed; on the 
contrary, this synthesis takes place for the first time in the regress, and 
never without it. But in such a case one can very well say that a regress 
to the conditions, i.e., a continued empirical synthesis on this side is demanded 
or given as a problem,d and that there could not fail to be conditions 
given through this regressY 
From this it is clear that the major premise of the cosmological syllogism 
takes the conditioned in the transcendental signification of a pure 
category, while the minor premise takes it in the empirical signification 
of a concept of the understanding applied to mere appearances; consequently 
there is present in it that dialectical deception that is called a B 528 
sophisma figurae dictionis.e This deception is, however, not artificial, but A500 
an entirely natural mistake of common reason. For through common 
reason, when something is given as conditioned, we presuppose (in the 
major premise) the conditions and their series as it were sight unseen,

because this is nothing but the logical requirement of assuming complete 
premises for a given conclusion, and no time-order is present in the 
connection of the conditioned with its condition; both are presupposed 
as given simultaneously. Further, it is likewise natural (in the minor 
premise) to regard appearances as things in themselves and likewise as 
objects given to the mere understanding, as was the case in the major 
premise, where I abstracted from all conditions of intuition under which 
alone objects can be given. But now in this we have overlooked a remarkable 
difference between the concepts. The synthesis of the conditioned 
with its condition and the whole series of the latter (in the major 
premise) carries with it no limitation through time and no concept of 
succession. The empirical synthesis, on the contrary, and the series of 
conditions in appearance (which are subsumed in the minor premise), is 
necessarily given successively and is given only in time, one member 
after another; consequently here I could not presuppose the absolute 
totality of synthesis and the series represented by it, as I could in the 
B 529 previous case, because there all members of the series are given in themselves 
(without time-condition), but here they are possible only through 

A 501 the successive regress, which is given only through one's actually completing 
it. 
When such a fallacy has been shown to ground the common argument 
(for the cosmological assertions), the demands of both disputing 
parties could rightfully be dismissed as being based on no wellgrounded 
title. But that does not put an end to their quarrel to the extent 
of winning them over to the view that one or both of them is wrong 
in what he actually asserts (in the conclusion), even if he does not know 
how to construct sound argumentsa for it. Nothing seems clearer than 
that between the two, one of whom asserts that the world has a beginning, 
and the other that it has no beginning but has existed from eternity, 
one of them has to be right. But if this is so, then because there is 
equal evidence b on both sides, it is impossible ever to ascertain which 
side is right, and so the conflict drags on as before, even though the parties 
have been directed by the court of reason to hold their peace. Thus 
no means is left for ending the dispute in a well-grounded way and to 
the satisfaction of both sides, unless through the fact that they can do 
such a fine job of refuting each other they are finally won over to the 
view that they are disputing about nothing, and that a certain transcendental 
illusion has portrayed a reality to them where none is present. 
This is the path on which we will now set forth in settling a dispute that 
cannot be decided by a final judgment.

Section VII. Critical decision of the cosmological conflict 

Zeno the elearic, a subtle dialectician, was already severely censured 
by Plato as a wanton sophist who, to show his art, would seek to prove 
some proposition through plausible arguments and then immediately to 
overthrow the same proposition through other arguments just as 
strong.73 He asserted that God (presumably for him this was nothing 
but the world) is neither finite nor infinite, is neither in motion nor at 
rest, and is neither like nor unlike any other thing. To those who judged 
him, it appeared that he wanted entirely to deny two mutually contradictory 
propositions, which is absurd. But I do not find that this charge 
can be justly lodged against him. I will throw more light on the first of 
these propositions presently. As to the others, if by the word God he 
understood the universe, then he must of course say that neither is it 
persistingly present in its place (at rest) nor does it alter its place (move), 
because all places are only in the universe, hence this universe itself is 
in no place. If the world-whole includes in itself everything existing, 
then it is neither like nor unlike any other thing, because there is no 
other thing outside it, with which it might be compared. If two mutu-B 531 
ally opposed judgments presuppose an inadmissible condition, then de-A 503 
spite their conflict (which is, however, not a real contradiction) both of 
them collapse, because the condition collapses under which alone either 
of them would be valid. 

If someone said that every body either smells good or smells not 
good, then there is a third possibility, namely that a body has no smell 
(aroma) at all, and thus both conflicting propositions can be false. If I 
say the body is either good-smelling or not good-smelling (vel suaveolens 
vel non suaveolens), then both judgments are contradictorily opposed, 
and only the first is false, but its contradictory opposite, namely 
that some bodies are not good-smelling, includes also those bodies that 
have no smell at all. In the previous opposition (per disparata)a the 
contingent condition of the concept of body (of smell) remained in the 
case of the conflicting judgment, and hence it was not ruled outb by it; 
hence the latter judgment was not the contradictory opposite of the 
former. 

Accordingly, if I say that as regards space either the world is infinite 
or it is not infinite (non est infinitus), then if the first proposition is false, 
its contradictory opposite, "the world is not infinite," must be true. 
Through it I would rule out only an infinite world, without positing another 
one, namely a finite one. But if it is said that the world is either A 504/ B 532 
infinite or finite (not-infinite), then both propositions could be false. 
For then I regard the world as determined in itself regarding its magnitude, 
since in the opposition I not only rule out its infinitude, and 

a through different things 
b aufgehoben 


517

with it, the whole separatea existence of the world, but I also add a determination 
of the world, as a thing active in itself, which might likewise 
be false, if, namely, the world were not given at all as a thing in 
itself, and hence, as regards its magnitude, neither as infinite nor as finite. 
Permit me to call such an opposition a dialectical opposition, but 
the contradictory one an analytical opposition.b Thus two judgments 
dialectically opposed to one another could both be false, because one 
does not merely contradict the other, but says something more than is 
required for a contradiction. 

If one regards the two propositions, "The world is infinite in magnitude," 
"The world is finite in magnitude," as contradictory opposites, 
then one assumes that the world (the whole series of appearances) is a 
thing in itself. For the world remains, even though I may rule out the 
infinite or finite regress in the series of its appearances. But if I take 
away this presupposition, or rather this transcendental illusion, and 

A 505 /B 533 deny that it is a thing in itself, then the contradictory conflict of the two 
assertions is transformed into a merely dialectical conflict, and because 
the world C does not exist at all (independently of the regressive series of 
my representations), it exists neither as an in itself infinite whole nor 
as an in itself finite whole. It is only in the empirical regress of the series 
of appearances, and by itself it is not to be met with at all. Hence if 
itd is always conditioned, then it is never wholly given, and the world is 
thus not an unconditioned whole, and thus does not exist as such a 
whole, either with infinite or with finite magnitude.74 
\Vhat has been said here about the first cosmological idea, namely 
the absolute totality of magnitude in appearance, holds also for the others. 
The series of appearances is to be encountered only in the regressive 
synthesis itself, but is not encountered in itself in appearance, as a 
thing on its own given prior to every regress. Hence I will have to say: 
the multiplicity of parts in a given appearance is in itself neither finite 
nor infinite, because appearance is nothing existing in itself, and the 
parts are given for the very first time through the regress of the decomposing 
synthesis, and in this regress, which is never given absolutely 
wholly either as finite nor as infinite. The very same holds of 
the series of causes ordered one above another, or of conditioned exis

selves as either finite or infinite in their totality, because, as series of 
subordinated representations, they exist only in the dynamical regress; 
but prior to this regress, and as a series of things subsisting for themselves, 
they cannot exist at all in themselves. 

Accordingly, the antinomy of pure reason in its cosmological ideas is 
removed by showing that it is merely dialectical and a conflict due to an 
illusion arising from the fact that one has applied the idea of absolute 
totality, which is valid only as a condition of things in themselves, to appearances 
that exist only in representation, and that, if they constitute a 
series, exist in the successive regress but otherwise do not exist at all. 
But one can, on the contrary, draw from this antinomy a true utility, not 
dogmatic but critical and doctrinal utility, namely that of thereby proving 
indirectly the transcendental ideality of appearances, if perhaps 
someone did not have enough in the direct proof in the Transcendental 
Aesthetic. The proof would consist in this dilemma. If the world is a 
whole existing in itself, then it is either finite or infinite. Now the first 
as well as the second alternative is false (according to the proofo offered 
above for the antithesis on the one side and the thesis on the other). 
Thus it is also false that the world (the sum total of all appearances) is B 535 
a whole existing in itself. From which it follows that appearances in A507 
general are nothing outside our representations, which is just what we 
mean by their transcendental ideality. 

This remark is of some importance. From it one sees that the above 
proofs of the fourfold antinomy are not semblances but well grounded, 
that is, at least on the presupposition that appearances, or a world of 
sense comprehending all of them within itself, are things in themselves. 
The conflict of the propositions drawn from it, however, uncovers a 
falsehood lying in this presupposition and thereby brings us to a discovery 
about the true constitution of things as objects of sense. Thus 
the transcendental dialectic by no means provides support for skepticism, 
though it does for the skeptical method, which can point to the 
dialectic as an example of the great utility of letting the arguments of 
reason confront one another in the most complete freedom; such arguments, 
although they may not deliver what one was seeking, nevertheless 
will always deliver something useful and serviceable for the 
correction of our judgments.b

The 
Antinomy of Pure Reason 
Section Eight 
The regulative principlea of pure reason in regard to the 
cosmological ideas. 

Since through the cosmological principle of totality no maximum in the 
series of conditions in a world of sense, as a thing in itself, is given, but 
rather this maximum can merely be given as a problemb in the regress 
of this series, the principle of pure reason we are thinking of retains 
its genuine validity only in a corrected significance not indeed as an 
axiom for thinking the totality in the objectd as real, but as a probleme 
for the understanding, thus for the subject in initiating and continuing, 
in accordance with the completeness of the idea, the regress in the series 
of conditions for a given conditioned. For in sensibility, i.e., in space 
and time, every condition to which we can attain in the exposition of 
given appearances is in turn conditioned, because these appearances are 
not objects in themselves in which the absolutely unconditioned might 
possibly occur, but only empirical representations, which must always 
find in intuition their condition, which determines them as regards 
space or time. Thus the principle of reason is only a rule, prescribing a 
A509/ B 537 regress in the series of conditions for given appearances, in which 
regress it is never allowed to stop with an absolutely unconditioned. 
Thus it is not a principle! of the possibility of experience and of the 
empirical cognition of objects of sense, hence not a principle of the understanding, 
for every experience is enclosed within its boundaries (conforming 
to the intuition in which it is given); nor is it a constitutive 
principleg of reason for extending the concept of the world of sense 
beyond all possible experience; rather it is a principle of the greatest 
possible continuation and extension of experience, in accordance with 
which no empirical boundary would hold as an absolute boundary; thus 
it is a principleh of reason which, as a rule, postulates what should be effectedi 
by us in the regress, but does not anticipate what is given in itself 
in the objectj prior to any regress. Hence I call it a regulative

principlea of reason, whereas the principle of the absolute totality of the 
series of conditions, as given in itself in the objectb (in the appearances), 
would be a constitutive cosmological principle, c the nullity of which 
I have tried to show through just this distinction, thereby preventing 
-what would otherwise unavoidably happen (through a transcendental 
subreption) -the ascription of objective reality to an idea that 

merely serves as a rule. 
Now in order to determine the sense of this rule of pure reason appropriately, 
it must first be noted that it cannot say what the objectd A5 IOI B 538 
is, but only how the empirical regress is to be instituted so as to attain 
to the complete concept of the object.' For if the former were the 
case, then it would be a constitutive principle! the likes of which is 
never possible on the basis of pure reason. Thus with it one can by no 
means have the intention to say that the series of conditions for a given 
conditioned is in itself finite or infinite; for in that way a mere idea of 
the absolute totality, which is produced only in the idea itself, would 
think an object that cannot be given in any experience, since an objective 
reality independent of empirical synthesis would be ascribed to a 
series of appearances. Thus the idea of reason will only prescribe a rule 
to the regressive synthesis in the series, a rule in accordance with which 
it proceeds from the conditioned, by means of all the conditions subordinated 
one to another, to the unconditioned, even though the latter 
will never be reached. For the absolutely unconditioned is not encountered 
in experience at all. 
To this end, the first thing to do is to determine precisely the syn


thesis of a series insofar as it is never complete. With this aim one usu


ally employs two expressions, which are supposed to draw a distinction, 

even though one does not know how to specify the ground of this dis


tinction correctly. Mathematicians speak solely of a progressus in infini


tum. g But those who study concepts (philosophers) want, in place of A5 I I I B 539 

this, to make the expression progressus in indefinitum h the only valid 

one.75 Without stopping to examine the reservations to which this dis


tinction has led, or to test whether their use has been good or fruitless, 

I will seek to determine these concepts precisely in relation to my own 

intentions.

finity, and here the distinction between the infinite and a progress of indeterminate 
length (progressus in indefinitum) would be an empty subtlety. 
For although when it is said, "Draw a line" it obviously sounds 
more correct to add in indefinitum than if it were said in infinitum, because 
the first means a no more than "Extend it as far as you want," but 
the second meansb "You ought never to stop extending it" (which is not 
at all intended here); yet if we are talking only about what can be done, 
then the first expression is entirely correct, for you could always make 
it greater, to infinity. And this is also the situation in all cases where one 
is speaking only of a forward progress,c i.e., of a progress from the condition 
to the conditioned; this possible progress in the series of appearances 
goes to infinity. From one pair of parents you could progress in a 
descending line of generation without end, and you could also think 


A51zlB540 that it might actually progress that way in the world. For here reason 
never needs an absolute totality in the series, because it is not presupposed 
as a condition as given (datum), but it is only added on as something 
conditioned, which is capable of being given (dabile), and this 
without end. 
It is entirely otherwise with the problem how far does the regress extend 
when it ascends from the given conditioned to its conditions in the 
series: whether I can say here that there is a regress to infinity or only 
a regress extending indetenninately far (in indefinitum), and whether 
from human beings now living I can ascend to infinity in the series of 
their ancestors, or whether it can be said only that as far as I have gone 
back, there has never been an empirical ground for holding the series to 
be bounded anywhere, so that for every forefather I am justified in seeking, 
and at the same time bound to seek, still further for his ancestors, 
though not to presuppose them? 
To this I say: If the whole was given in empirical intuition, then the 
regress in the series of its inner conditions goes to infinity. But if only 
one member of the series is given, from which the regress to an absolute 
totality is first of all to proceed, then only an indeterminate kind of 


A513/B 541 regress (in indefinitum) takes place. Thus of the division of matter (of a 
body) that is given within certain boundaries, it must be said that it goes 
to infinity. For this matter is given in empirical intuition as a whole, and 
consequently with all its possible parts. Now since the condition of this 
whole is its part, and the condition of this part is a part made of parts, 
etc., and in this regress of decomposition an unconditioned (indivisible) 
member of this series of conditions is never encountered, not only is

Section VIII. The regulative principle of pure reason 
there nowhere an empirical ground to stop the division, but the further 
members of the continuing division are themselves empirically given 
prior to this ongoing division, i.e., the division goes to infinity. On the 
contrary, the series of ancestors for a given human being is not given in 
its absolute totality in any possible experience, but the regress goes 
from each member of this generation to a higher one, so that no empirical 
boundary is to be encountered that would exhibit one member 
as absolutely unconditioned. But since the members that might supply 
the conditions for it nevertheless do not already lie in the empirical intuition 
of the whole prior to the regress, this regress does not go to infinity 
(by division of the given) but goes to an indeterminate distance, 
searching for more members for the given, which are once again always 
given only conditionally. 
In neither of these two cases, that of the regressus in infinitum as well A 5 14/ B 542 
as in that of the in indefinitum, is the series of conditions regarded as 
being given as infinite in the object.a It is not things in themselves that 
are given, but only appearances, which, as conditions of one another, are 
given only in the regress itself. Thus the question is no longer how big 
this series of conditions is in itself -whether it is finite or infinite -for 
it is nothing in itself; rather, the question is how we are to institute the 
empirical regress and how far we are to continue it. And then there is a 
difference worth noting in regard to the rule to be followed in this 
progress. If the whole has been empirically given, then it is possible to 
go back to infinity in the series of its inner conditions. But if that whole 
is not given, but rather is first to be given only through an empirical 
regress, then I can say only that it is possible to progress to still higher 
conditions in the series to infinity. In the first case I could say: There 
are always more members there, and empirically given, than I reach 
through the regress (of decomposition); but in the second case I can say 
only: I can always go still further in the regress, because no member is 
empirically given as absolutely unconditioned, and thus a higher member 
may be admitted as possible and hence the inquiry after it may be admitted 
as necessary. In the former case it was necessary to encounter 
more members of the series, but in the latter case it is always necessary 
to inquire after more of them, because no experience is bounded abA51rS/
BrS43 
solutely. For you have either no perception that absolutely bounds your 
empirical regress, and then you must not hold your regress to be complete; 
or if you have such a perception bounding your series, then this 
cannot be a part of your regressive series (because that which bounds 
must be distinguished from that which is bounded by it), and so you 
have to continue your regress further to this condition, and so on.

The following section will place these remarks in a suitable light by 
giving them an application. 


The Antinomy of Pure Reason 
Section Nine 
On the empirical use of the regulative principle a of reason, 
in regard to all cosmological ideas. 

Since, as we have repeatedly shown, there is just as little transcendental 
use of pure concepts of understanding as there is of concepts of reason, 
because the absolute totality of series of conditions in the world of sense 
is based solely on a transcendental use of reason that demands this unconditioned 
completeness from what it presupposes is a thing in itself; 
and since the world of sense, however, contains nothing like that completeness, 
there can never again be an issue about the absolute magnitude 
of the series in this world, whether it might be bounded or in itself 
unbounded, but only about how far we should go back in the empirical 
regress when we trace experience back to its conditions, so that, following 
the rule of reason, we do not stop with any answer to its questions 
except that which is appropriate to the object. 

Thus the only thing left to us is the validity of the principleh of reason 
as a rule for the continuation and magnitude of a possible experience, 
once its invalidity as a constitutive principle of appearances in 
themselves has been adequately demonstrated. If we can keep the former 
in view and beyond doubt, then the conflict of reason with itself 
will also be entirely at an end, since not only will the illusion that put 
reason at odds with itself have been done away with through its critical 
dissolution, but in place of it, that sense will have been uncovered in 
which reason agrees with itself, and whose misinterpretation was the 
sole cause of the conflict; and a principle that would otherwise be dialectical 
will be transformed into a doctrinal principle. In fact, if this 
principle can be preserved in its subjective signification for suitably determining 
the greatest possible use of the understanding in experience 
in regard to its objects, then that would be just as if the principle were 
(what it is impossible to get from pure reason) an axiom determining 
objects in themselves a priori; for even this could have no greater influence 
on the extension and correction of our cognition in regard to objectsC 
of experience than by actively proving itself in the most extensive 
use of our understanding in experience.

Section IX. On the empirical use of the regulative principle 

Resolution of the cosmological idea 
of the totality of the composition of the appearances 
of a world-whole. 
Here, as well as in the case of the remaining cosmological questions, the 
ground of the regulative principle of reason is the proposition that in 
the empirical regress there can be encountered no experience of an absolute 
boundary, and hence no experience of a condition as one that is 
absolutely unconditioned empirically. The reason for this, however, is 
that such an experience would have to contain in itself a bounding of appearance 
by nothing, or by the void, which the regress, carried on far 
enough, would have to encounter by means of a perception which 
is 
impossible. 
Now this proposition, which says only that in the empirical regress I 
can always attain only to a condition that must itself in turn be regarded A5I8/B 546 
as empirically conditioned, contains the rule in terminsb that however 
far I may have come in the ascending series, I must always inquire after 
a higher member of the series, whether or not this member may come 
to be known to me through experience. 
Now nothing further is required for the resolution of the first cosmological 
problem except to settle whether, in the regress to the unconditioned 
magnitude of the world-whole (in time and in space), this 
never bounded ascent can be called a regress to infinity, or only an indeterminately 
continued regress (in indefinitum). 
The merely general representation of the series of all past states of 
the world, as well as of the things that simultaneously exist in the 
world's space, is nothing other than a possible empirical regress that I 
think, though still indeterminately, and through which alone there can 
arise the concept of such a series of conditions for a given perception.* 
Now I always have the world-whole only in concept, but by no means AF9/B 547 
(as a whole) in intuition. Thus I cannot infer from its magnitude to the 
magnitude of the regress, and determine the latter according to the for* 
This world-series' can thus be neither bigger nor smaller than the possible A 5 18/ B 546 
empirical regress, on which alone its concept rests. And since this cannot yield 
a determinate infinite, nor yet something determinately finite (something absolutely 
bounded), it is clear from this that we can assume the magnitude of 
the world to be neither finite nor infinite, since the regress (through which 

this magnitude is represented) admits of neither of the two.

mer, but rather it has to be through the magnitude of the empirical 
regress that I first make for myself a concept of the magnitude of the 
world. About this regress, however, I never know anything more than 
that from any given member of the series of conditions I must always 
proceed empirically to a higher (more remote) member. Thus by that 
means the magnitude of the whole of appearances is never determined 
absolutely; hence also one cannot say that this regress goes to infinity, 
because this would anticipate the members to which the regress has not 
yet attained, and would represent their multiplicity a as so great that no 
empirical synthesis can attain to it; consequently, it would detennine 
(though only negatively) the magnitude of the world prior to the 
regress, which is impossible. For the latter (in its totality) is not given 
to me through any intuition, hence its magnitude is not given at all 
prior to the regress. Accordingly, we can say nothing at all about the 
magnitude of the world in itself, not even that in it there is the regressus 
in infinitum,b but rather we must seek the concept of its magnitude only 
according to the rule determining the empirical regress in it. But this 
rule says nothing more than that however far we may have come in the 
series of empirical conditions, we should never assume an absolute 


A 520/ B 548 boundary, but rather we should subordinate every appearance as conditioned 
to another as its condition, and thus we must progress further to 
this condition; this is a regressus in indefinitum,c which, because it determines 
no magnitude in the object,d can be distinguished clearly enough 
from the regress in infinitum. 
Accordingly, I cannot say the world is infinite in past time or in 
space. For such a concept of magnitude, as a given infinity, is empirical, 
hence it is absolutely impossible in regard to the world as an object of 
sense. I will also not say that the regress from a given perception to 
everything bounding it in a series, in space and in past time, goes to infinity; 
for this presupposes the infinite magnitude of the world; nor will 
I say that it is finite; for an absolute boundary is likewise empirically 
impossible. Accordingly, I will be able to say nothing about the whole 
object of experience (the world of sense), but only something about the 
rule in accord with which experience, suitably to its object, is to be instituted 
and continued. 
Thus to the cosmological question about the magnitude of the world, 
the first and negative answer is: The world has no first beginning in 
time and no outermost boundary in space. 
For in the opposite case, it would be bounded by empty time on the 


A52 I /B 549 one side and by empty space on the other. Now since as appearance it

Section IX. On the empirical use of the regulative principle 
cannot in itself be either of these, because appearance is not a thing in 
itself, a perception of boundedness through absolutely empty time or 
empty space would have to be possible, through which these worldends 
would have to be given in a possible experience. But such an experience, 
as completely empty of content, is impossible. Thus an absolute 
boundary of the world is empirically impossible, and hence also 
absolutely impossible.* 
From this follows at the same time the affirmative answer: The 
regress in the series of appearances in the world, as a determination of 
the magnitude of the world, goes on in indefinitum, which is as much as 
to say that the world of sense has no absolute magnitude, but the empirical 
regress (through which alone it can be given on the side of its 
conditions) has its rule, namely always to progress from each member 
of the series, as a conditioned, to a still more remote member (whether 
by means of one's own experience, or the guiding thread of history, or AS2 2 /B 550 
the chain of effects and their causes), and nowhere to exceed the extension 
of the possible empirical use of one's understanding, since this extension 
is the sole and proper business of reason in its principles.a 
What is not prescribed here is a determinate empirical regress that 
continues in a certain kind of appearance without ever ceasing, e.g., that 
from a living human being one must always ascend in the series of his 
ancestors without ever expecting a first pair, or in the series of bodies in 
the world without admitting an outermost sun; on the contrary, what is 
required is only the progress from appearances to appearances, even if 
they should not yield any actual perception (if this perception is too 
weak in degree to become an experience for our consciousness), because 
despite this they would still belong to possible experience.76 
Every beginning is in time, and every boundary of the extended is in 
space. Space and time, however, are only in the world of sense. Hence 
appearances are in the world only conditionally, the world itself is neither 
conditioned nor bounded in an unconditional way. 
Just for this reason, and since the world cannot be given as a whole, 
and even the series of conditions for a given conditioned, as a worldseries, 
cannot be given as a whole, the concept of the magnitude of 
* One will note that the proof is carried on here in an entirely different way AS 2 I /B 549 
from the dogmatic one in the antithesis of the first antinomy. There, in accordance 
with the common and dogmatic way of representing it, we let the 
world of sense count as a thing whose totality is given in itself prior to any 
regress, and, if it did not occupy all space and all time, we denied it any determinate 
place in space and time. Hence the conclusion was different from 
this one too: namely, the actual infinity of the world was inferred.

A 523/ B 551 the world is given only through the regress, and not given prior to it in 
a collective intuition. But the regress consists only in a determining of 
the magnitude, and thus it does not give a determinate concept, a concept 
of a magnitude that would be infinite in regard to a certain measure; 
thus it does not go to infinity (given, as it were), but goes only 
indeterminately far, so as to give a magnitude (of experience) that first 
becomes actual through this regress. 


II. 

Resolution of the cosmological idea 
of the totality of division of a given whole 
in intuition. 


If I divide a whole that is given in intuition, then I go from a conditioned 
to the conditions of its possibility. The division of the parts (subdivisio 
or decompositio) is a regress in the series of these conditions. The 
absolute totality of this series would be given only when and if the 
regress could attain to simple parts. But if each of the parts in a continuously 
progressing decomposition is once again divisible, then the 
division, i.e., the regress from the conditioned to its condition, goes in 
infinitum;U for the conditions (the parts) are contained in the condi-

A524/B 552 tioned itself, and since this conditioned is given as a whole in an intuition 
enclosed within its boundaries, the conditions are all given along 
with it. The regress thus may not be called merely a regress in indefinitum, 
as only the previous cosmological idea allowed, where I was to 
proceed from the conditioned to conditions outside it, which were not 
given simultaneously with it, but were first added to it in the empirical 
regress. Despite this, it is by no means permitted to say of such a whole, 
which is divisible to infinity, that it consists of infinitely many parts. 
For though all the parts are contained in the intuition of the whole, 
the whole division is not contained in it; this division consists only 
in the progressive decomposition, or in the regress itself, which first 
makes the series actual. Now since this regress is infinite, all its members 
(parts) to which it has attained are of course contained in the whole 
as an aggregate, but the whole series of the division is not, since it 
is infinite successively and never is as a whole; consequently, the regress 
cannot exhibit any infinite multiplicityb or the taking together of 
this multiplicity into one whole. 
This general reminder is, first, very easily applied to space. Every space 
intuited within its boundaries is such awhole, whose parts in every decomposition 
are in turn spaces, and it is therefore divisible to infinity.

Section IX. On the empirical use of the regulative principle 

From this there also follows quite naturally the second application, to A52 5 1B 553 

an external appearance enclosed within its boundaries (a body). Its divi


sion is grounded on the divisibility of space, which constitutes the pos


sibility of the body as an extended whole. The latter is thus divisible to 

infinity, without, however, therefore consisting of infinitely many parts. 
To be sure, it appears that since a body has to be represented as a substance 
in space, it is to be distinguished from a space as far as the law of 
the divisibi]jty of space is concerned; for one can in any case concede 
that the decomposition of the latter could never do away with all composition, 
since then every space, having nothing else that is self-subsistent, 
would cease to be (which is impossible); yet it does not seem to be 
compatible with the concept of a substance -which is really supposed 
to be the subject of all composition, and has to remain in its elements 
even if its connection in space, by which it constitutes a body, were removed 
-that if all composition of matter were removed in thought, 
then nothing at all would remain. Yet with that which is called substance 
in appearance things are not as they would be with a thing in itself 
which one thought through pure concepts of the understanding. 
The former is not an absolute subject, but only a persisting image of 
sensibility, and it is nothing but intuition, in which nothing uncondi-A 5261 B 554 
tioned is to be encountered anywhere. 
But now although this rule of progress to infinity applies without any 

doubt to the subdivision of an appearance as a mere filling of space, it 

cannot hold if we want to stretch it to cover the multiplicity of parts al


ready detached with certainty in a given whole, constituting thereby a 

quantum discretum.a,n To assume that in every whole that is articulated 

into membersb (organized), every part is once again articulated, and 

that in such a way, by dismantling the parts to infinity, one always en


counters new complex partsC -in a word, to assume that the whole is ar


ticulated to infinity -this is something that cannot be thought at all, 

even though the parts of matter, reached by its decomposition to infin


ity, could be articulated. For the infinity of the division of a given ap


pearance in space is grounded solely on the fact that through this 

infinity merely its divisibility, i.e., a multiplicity of parts, which is in it


self absolutely indeterminate, is given, but the parts themselves are 

given and determined only through the subdivision -in short, on the 

fact that the whole is not in itself already divided up. Hence the division 

can determine a multiplicity as far as one wants to proceed in the 

regress of the division. In the case of an organic body articulated to in


finity, on the contrary, the whole is represented through this very con-A527/B555

cept as already divided up, and a multiplicity of parts, determinate in 
itself but infinite, is encountered prior to every regress in the division 
-through which one contradicts oneself, since this infinite development 
is regarded as a series that is never to be completed (as infinite) 
and yet as one that is completed when it is taken together. The infinite 
division indicates only the appearance as quantum continuum,a and is inseparable 
from the filling of space; for the ground of its infinite divisibility 
lies precisely in that. But as soon as something is assumed as a 
quantum discretum,b the multiplicity of units in it is determined; hence it 
is always equal to a number. Thus only experience can settle how far the 
organization in an articulated body may go; and even if it was certain to 
attain to no inorganic parts, such parts must nevertheless at least lie 
within a possible experience. But how far the transcendental division of 
an appearance in general may reach is not a matter of experience at all, 
but it is rather a principle< of reason never to take the empirical regress 
in the composition of what is extended, in conformity with the nature 
of this appearance, to be absolutely complete.

When we represented the antinomy of pure reason in a table through 
all the transcendental ideas, where we showed the ground of this conflict 
and the only means of removing it -which consisted in declaring 
both of the opposed assertions to be false -we in all cases represented 
the conditions for their conditioned as belonging to relations of space 
and time, which is the usual presupposition of common human understanding, 
on which, therefore, the conflict entirely rested. In this respect 
all dialectical representations of totality in the series of conditions 
for a given conditioned were of the same kindd throughout. There was 
always a series, in which the condition was connected with the conditioned 
as a member of the series, and thereby was homogeneous, e

to happen, a member conditioned in itself would have to be falsely as

sumed to be a first, and hence unconditioned member. Thus it would 
not always be the object,tT i.e., the conditioned, but the series of conditions 
for it, which was so considered merely in its magnitude; and then A 5291 B 557 
the difficulty -which could not be removed by any compromise, but 
only by completely cutting the knot -consisted in the fact that reason 
made it either too long or too short for the understanding, so that the 
understanding could never come out equal to reason's idea. 

But in this we have overlooked an essential distinction governing the 
objects/ i.e., among the concepts of the understanding which reason aspires 
to raise to ideas, namely, that according to our table of categories 
two of them signifY mathematical, but the other two a dynamical synthesis 
of appearances. Until now this was all right, since just as in the 
general representation of all transcendental ideas we always stayed only 
within appearance, so in the two mathematical-transcendental ideas 
we had no object other than one in appearance. Now, however, that we 
are progressing to dynamical concepts of the understanding, insofar as 
they are to be suited to the idea of reason, this distinction comes to be 
important, and opens up for us an entirely new prospect in regard to the 
suit in which reason has become implicated; whereas up to now it has 
been dismissed as based on false presuppositions on both sides, now 
perhaps in the dynamical antinomy there is a presupposition that can ABo/B 558 
coexist with the pretensions of reason, and since the judge may make 
good the defects in legal grounds that have been misconstrued on both 
sides, the case can be mediated to the satisfaction of both parties, which 
could not be done in the controversy about the mathematical antinomy. 

The series of conditions are obviously all homogeneous to the extent 
that one looks solely at how far they reach: whether they conform to 
the idea, or are too big or too small for it. Yet the concept of understanding 
grounding these ideas contains either solely a synthesis of 
homogeneous things (which is presupposed in the case of every magnitude, 
in its composition as well as its division), or else a synthesis of 
things not homogeneous, which must be at least admitted in the case 
of the dynamical synthesis, in causal connection as well as in the connection 
of the necessary with the contingent. 

Hence it is that in the mathematical connection of series of appearances, 
none other than a sensible condition can enter, i.e., only one 
that is itself a part of the series; whereas the dynamic series of sensible 
conditions, on the contrary, allows a further condition different in kind, 
one that is not a part of the series but, as merely intelligible, lies outside 
the series; in this way reason can be given satisfaction and the un-A 53 II B 559 
conditioned can be posited prior to appearances without confounding 

n Object

531 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. II 

the series of appearances, which is always conditioned, and without any 
violation of principles of the understanding. 

Now by the fact that the dynamical ideas allow a condition of appearances 
outside the series of appearances, i.e., a condition that is not 
appearance, something happens that is entirely different from the result 
of the mathematical antinomy. In the latter it was the cause of the fact 
that both dialectically opposed assertions had to be declared false. The 
thoroughly conditioned character of what is in the dynamical series, 
on the contrary, which is inseparable from them as appearances, is 
connected with a condition that is empirically unconditioned, but also 
nonsensible, which gives satisfaction to the understanding on one 
side and to reason on the other,* and while the dialectical arguments 
that seek unconditioned totality on the one side or the other collapse, 

A53z1B 560 the rational propositions, on the contrary, taken in such a corrected significance, 
may both be true; which could never have occurred with the 
cosmological ideas dealing merely with mathematically unconditioned 
unity, because with them there is no condition of the series of appearances 
that is not itself also an appearance, constituting as such a further 
member of the series. 

III. 

Resolution of the cosmological ideaa 
of the totality of the derivation of occurrences in 
the world 
from their causes. 

In respect of what happens, one can think of causality in only two ways: 
either according to nature or from freedom. The first is the connection 
of a state with a preceding one in the world of sense upon which 
that state follows according to a rule. Now since the causality of appearances 
rests on temporal conditions, and the preceding state, if it 
always existed, could not have produced any effect that first arose in 
time, the causality of the cause of what happens or arises has also 

A53I/B 559 * For the understanding does not permit among appearances any condition 
that is itself empirically unconditioned. But if an intelligible condition, which 
therefore does not belong to the series of appearances as a member, may be 
thought for a conditioned (in appearance), without thereby interrupting in the 
least the series of empirical conditions, then such a condition could be admitted 
as empirically unconditioned, in such a way that no violation of the empirically 
continuous regress would occur anywhere.

arisen, and according to the principle of understanding it III turn 
needs a cause.a 

By freedom in the cosmological sense, on the contrary, I understand A 5 3 3! B 56I 
the faculty of beginning a state from itself, b the causality of which does 
not in turn stand under another cause determining it in time in accordance 
with the law of nature. Freedom in this signification is a pure 
transcendental idea, which, first, contains nothing borrowed from experience, 
and second, the object of which also cannot be given determinately 
in any experience, because it is a universal law -even of the 
possibility of all experience -that everything that happens must have a 
cause, and hence that the causality of the cause, as itself having happened 
or arisen, must in turn have a cause; through this law, then, the 
entire field of experience, however far it may reach, is transformed into 
the sum total of mere nature. But since in such a way no absolute totality 
of conditions in causal relationsc is forthcoming, reason creates the 
idea of a spontaneity, which could start to act from itself, without needing 
to be preceded by any other cause that in turn determines it to action 
according to the law of causal connection. 

It is especially noteworthy that it is this transcendental idea of freedom 
on which the practical concept of freedom is grounded, and the 
former constitutes the real moment of the difficulties in the latter,d 
which have long surrounded the question of its possibility. Freedom in A534! B 562 
the practical sense is the independence of the power of choice from 
necessitation by impulses of sensibility. For a power of choice is sensible 
insofar as it is pathologically affected (through moving-causes of 
sensibility); it is called an animal power of choice (arbitrium brutum) if 
it can be pathologically necessitated. The human power of choice is 
indeed an arbitrium sensitivum,e yet not brutum! but liberum,g because 
sensibility does not render its action necessary, but in the human being 
there is a faculty of determining oneself from oneself, independently of 
necessitation by sensible impulses.79 

It is easy to see that if all causality in the world of sense were mere 
nature, then every occurrence would be determined in time by another 
in accord with necessary laws, and hence -since appearances, insofar as 
they determine the power of choice, would have to render every action

necessary as their natural consequence -the abolition of transcendental 
freedom would also simultaneously eliminate all practical freedom. For 
the latter presupposes that although something has not happened, it 
nevertheless ought to have happened, and its cause in appearance was 
thus not so determining that there is not a causality in our power of 
choice such that, independently of those natural causes and even opposed 
to their power and influence, it might produce something determined 
in the temporal order in accord with empirical laws, and hence 
begin a series of occurrences entirely from itself. 


A5 3 5 / B 563 Here, then, as is generally found in the conflicts of reason with itself 
when it ventures beyond the boundaries of possible experience, the 
problem is really not physiological but transcendental. Hence the 
question of the possibility of freedom does indeed assail psychology, but 
since it rests merely on dialectical arguments of pure reason, its solution 
must be solely the business of transcendental philosophy. Now in ordera 
to put transcendental philosophy, which cannot decline to provide a satisfying 
answer here, in a position to give one, I must first seek, through 
the following remark, to determine more closely its procedure in dealing 
with this problem. 


If appearances were things in themselves, and hence space and time 
were the forms of things in themselves, then the conditions would always 
belong to one and the same series as the conditioned, and from 
this there would also arise in the present case the antinomy common to 
all transcendental ideas, that this series must unavoidably turn out to be 
either too large or too small for the understanding. But the dynamical 
concepts of reason, with which we are concerned in this and the following 
number, have the peculiarity that since they do not consider

can thus abstract from the magnitude of the series of conditions, and 


A536/B 564 with them it is merely a matter of the dynamical relation b of condition

nature and freedom is only whether freedom is possible anywhere at all, 
and if it is, whether it can exist together with the universality of the natural 
law of causality, hence whether it is a correct disjunctive proposition 
that every effect in the world must arise either from nature or 
freedom, or whether instead both, each in a different relation, might be 
able to take place simultaneously in one and the same occurrence. The 
correctness of the principle of the thoroughgoing connection of all occurrences 
in the world of sense according to invariable natural laws is 
already confirmed as a principle of the transcendental analytic and will 
suffer violation. Thus the only question is whether, despite this, in re

Section IX. On the empirical use of the regulative principle 

gard to the very same effect that is determined by nature, freedom 
might not also take place, or is this entirely excluded through that inviolable 
rule? And here the common but deceptive presupposition of the 
absolute reality of appearance immediately shows its disadvantageous 
influence for confusing reason. For if appearances are things in themselves, 
then freedom cannot be saved. Then nature is the completely 
determining cause, sufficient in itself, of every occurrence, and the condition 
for an occurrence is always contained only in the series of appearances 
that, along with their effect, are necessary under the law of 
nature. If, on the other hand, appearances do not count for any more 
than they are in fact, namely, not for things in themselves but only for 
mere representations connected in accordance with empirical laws, 
then they themselves must have grounds that are not appearances. Such 
an intelligible cause, however, will not be determined in its causality by 
appearances, even though its effects appear and so can be determined 
through other appearances. Thus the intelligible cause, with its causality, 
is outside the series; its effects, on the contrary, are encountered in 
the series of empirical conditions. The effect can therefore be regarded 
as free in regard to its intelligible cause, and yet simultaneously, in regard 
to appearances, as their result according to the necessity of nature; 
this is a distinction which, if it is presented in general and entirely abstractly, 
must appear extremely subtle and obscure, but in its application 
it will be enlightening. Here I have only wanted to note that since the 
thoroughgoing connection of all appearances in one context of nature 
is an inexorable law, it necessarily would have to bring down all freedom 
if one were stubbornly to insist on the reality of appearances. Hence 
even those who follow the common opinion about this matter have 
never succeeded in uniting nature and freedom with one another. 

The possibility of causality through freedom unified with 
the universal law of natural necessity. 80 

I call intelligible that in an object of sense which is not itself appearance. 
Accordingly, if that which must be regarded as appearance in the world 
of sense has in itself a faculty which is not an object of intuition through 
which it can be the cause of appearances, then one can consider the 
causality of this being in two aspects, as intelligible in its action as a 
thing in itself, and as sensible in the effects of that action as an appearance 
in the world of sense. Of the faculty of such a subject we would accordingly 
form an empirical and at the same time an intellectual concept 
of its causality, both of which apply to one and the same effect. a Think


a Kant adds in his copy of the first edition: "Transcendental definitions: The causality of 

representations of a being in respect of the objects of them is life. The determinability 

of the power of representation to this causality is the faculty of desire. This power of

ing of the faculty of an object of sense in this double aspect does not contradict 
any of the concepts we have to fonn of appearances and of a possible 
experience. For since these appearances, because they are not 
things in themselves, must be grounded in a transcendental object determining 
them as mere representations, nothing hinders us from ascribing 
to this transcendental object, apart from the property through 
which it appears, also another causality that is not appearance, even 
though its effect is encountered in appearance. But every effective cause 
must have a character, i.e., a law of its causality, without which it would 
not be a cause at all. And then for a subject of the world of sense we 
would have first an empirical character, through which its actions, as 
appearances, would stand through and through in connection with other 
appearances in accordance with constant natural laws, from which, as 
their conditions, they could be derived; and thus, in combination with 
these other appearances, they would constitute members of a single series 
of the natural order. Yet second, one would also have to aU ow this 
subject an intelligible character, through which it is indeed the cause 
of those actions as appearances, but which does not stand under any conditions 
of sensibility and is not itself appearance. The first one could call 
the character of such a thing in appearance, the second its character as a 
thing in itself. 

Now this acting subject, in its intelligible character, would not stand 
under any conditions of time, for time is only the condition of appearances 
but not of things in themselves.8r In that subject no action would 
arise or perish, hence it would not be subject to the law of everything 
alterable in its time-determination that everything that happens must 
find its cause in the appearances (of the previous state). In a word, its 
causality, insofar as it is intellectual, would not stand in the series of empirical 
conditions that makes the occurrence in the world of sense necessary. 
This intelligible character could, of course, never be knowna 
immediately, because we cannot perceive anything except insofar as it 
appears, but it would have to be thought in conformity with the empirical 
character, just as in general we must ground appearances in 
thought through a transcendental object, even though we know nothing 
about it as it is in itself. 

In its empirical character, this subject, as appearance, would thus be 

representation, if it is reason, hence is the determinability of its causality in respect of 

objects, i.e., its faculty of desire [is] will. If pure reason has causality, then the will is a 

pure will, and its causality is called freedom. 

"[Now] we cannot cognize [a priorl1 any causes, nor in general any intuitions corre


sponding to the categories, or relationships between them, but we must take all these 

from experience. Hence whether freedom is possible cannot be settled." (E CLXXIII,

Section IX. On the empirical use of the regulative principle 

subject to the causal connection, in accordance with all the laws of determination; 
and to that extent it would be nothing but a part of the 
world of sense, whose effects, like those of any other appearance, would 
flow inevitably from nature. Just as external appearances influence it, as 
far as its empirical character, i.e., the law of its causality, is known 
through experience, all its actions would have to admit of explanation 
in accordance with natural laws, and all the requisites for a perfect and 
necessary determination of them would have to be encountered in a 
possible experience. 

But in its intelligible character (even though we can have nothing A 541 / B 569 
more than merely the general concept of it), this subject would nevertheless 
have to be declared free of all influences of sensibility and determination 
by appearances; and since, in it, insofar as it is a noumenon, 
nothing happens, thus no alteration requiring a dynamical time-determination 
is demanded, and hence no connection with appearances as 
causes is encountered in its actions, this active being would to this extent 
be independent and free of all the natural necessity present solely in the 
world of sense. Of it one would say quite correctly that it begins its effects 
in the sensible world from itself, without its action beginning in it 
itself; and this would hold without allowing effects in the world of sense 
to begin from themselves, because in this world they are always determined 
beforehand by empirical conditions in the preceding time, but 
only by means of the empirical character (which is a mere appearance of 
the intelligible character), and they are possible only as a continuation of 
the series of natural causes. Thus freedom and nature, each in its full significance, 
would both be found in the same actions, simultaneously and 
without any contradiction, according to whether one compares them 
with their intelligible or their sensible cause.

I have found it good first to sketch the silhouette of a solution to our

reason in solving it. Now we will set out separately the decisive mo

of the field of sensibility to something real outside it, practical reason is able to do, 

namely, giving an existence that is not sensible, [and] through laws that are grounded 

on reason. This is morality, if one admits it through freedom. 

"Otherwise we would assume that there is no intuition at all without [the] senses and 

hence also no things outside the objects of sense belonging to intuition." (E CLxxrv, 

p. 52; 23:41-2) 

537

ments on which the solution really depends, and take each particular 
moment into consideration. 

The law of nature that everything that happens has a cause, that since 
the causality of this cause, i.e., the action, precedes in time and in respect 
of an effect that has arisen cannot have been always but must have happened, 
and so must also have had its cause among appearances, through 
which it is determined, and consequently that all occurrences are empirically 
determined in a natural order -this law, through which alone appearances 
can first constitute one nature and furnish objects of one 
experience, is a law of the understanding, from which under no pretext 
can any departure be allowed or any appearance be exempted; because 
otherwise one would put this appearance outside of all possible experi-

A5431 B 57 I ence, thereby distinguishing it from all objects of possible experience and 
making it into a mere thought-entity and a figment of the brain. 
But although it looks as if there is solely a chain of causes, permitting 
no absolute totality at all in the regress to their conditions, this reservation 
does not detain us at all; for it has already been removed in our 
general judgment on the antinomy of reason occurring when reason 
proceeds to the unconditioned in the series of appearances. If we would 
give in to the deception of transcendental realism, then neither nature 
nor freedom would be left. Here the question is only: If in the whole series 
of all occurrences one recognizes purelY' natural necessity, is it nevertheless 
possible to regard the same occurrence, which on the one 
hand is a mere effect of nature, as on the other hand an effect of freedom; 
or will a direct contradiction between these two kinds of causality 
be found? 
Among the causes in appearance there can surely be nothing that 
could begin a series absolutely and from itself. Every action, as appearance, 
insofar as it produces an occurrence, is itself an occurrence, or 
event, which presupposes another state in which its cause is found; and 
thus everything that happens is only a continuation of the series, and no 
beginning that would take place from itself is possible in it. Thus in the 


A5441 B 572 temporal succession all actions of natural causes are themselves in turn 
effects, which likewise presuppose their causes in the time-series. An 
original action, through which something happens that previously was 
not, is not to be expected from the causal connection of appearances. 
But then if the effects are appearances, is it also necessary that the 
causality of their cause, which (namely, the cause) is also appearance, 
must be solely empirical?82 Is it not rather possible that although for 
every effect in appearance there is required a connectionb with its cause 
in accordance with laws of empirical causality, this empirical causality 

a tauter 
b Verkniipfung 


538 



Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. II 

causality must stand under empirical laws. As such he must accordingly 
also have an empirical character, just like all other natural things. We 
notice it through powers and faculties which it expresses in its effects. 
In the case of lifeless nature and nature having merely animal life, we 
find no ground for thinking of any faculty which is other than sensibly 
conditioned. Yet the human being, who is otherwise acquainted with 
the whole of nature solely through sense, knowso himself also through 
pure apperception, and indeed in actions and inner determinations 
which cannot be accounted at all amongb impressions of sense; he obviously 
is in one part phenomenon, but in another part, namely in regard 
to certain faculties, he is a merely intelligible object, because the 

A 547/ B 575 actions of this object cannot at all be ascribedc to the receptivity of sensibility. 
We call these faculties understanding and reason; chiefly the 
latter is distinguished quite properly and preeminently from all empirically 
conditioned powers, since it considers its objects merely according 
to ideas and in accordance with them determines the understanding, 
which then makes an empirical use of its own concepts (even 
the pure ones). 
Now that this reason has causality,d or that we can at least represent 
something of the sort in it, is clear from the imperatives that we propose 
e as rules to our powers of execution in everything practical. 83 The 
ought expresses a species of necessity and a connection with grounds 
which does not occur anywhere else in the whole of nature. In nature 
the understanding can cognize only what exists, or has been, or will be. 
lt is impossible that something in it ought to be other than what, in all 
these time-relations/ it in fact is; indeed, the ought, if one has merely 
the course of nature before one's eyes, has no significance whatever. We 
cannot ask at all what ought to happen in nature, any more than we can 
ask what properties a circle ought to have; but we must rather ask what 
happens in nature, or what properties the circle has. 

Now this "ought" expresses a possible action, the ground of which is 
nothing other than a mere concept, whereas the ground of a merely 
A 548 / B 576 natural action must always be an appearance. Now of course the action 
must be possible under natural conditions if the ought is directed to it; 
but these natural conditions do not concern the determination of the 
power of choice itself, but only its effect and result in appearance. How

Section IX. On the empirical use of the regulative principle 

ever many natural grounds or sensible stimuli there may be that impel 
me to will, they cannot produce the ought but only a willing that is yet 
far from necessary but rather always conditioned, over against which 
the ought that reason pronounces sets a measure and goal, indeed, a 
prohibition and authorization.a Whether it is an object of mere sensibility 
(the agreeable) or even of pure reason (the good), reason does not 
give in to those grounds which are empirically given, and it does not 
follow the order of things as they are presented in intuition, but with 
complete spontaneity it makes its own order according to ideas, to 
which it fits the empirical conditions and according to which it even declares 
actions to be necessary that yet have not occurred and perhaps 
will not occur, nevertheless presupposing of all such actions that reason 
could have causality in relation to them; for without that, it would not 
expect its ideas to have effects in experience. 

Now let us stop at this point and assume it is at least possible that reason 
actually does have causality in regard to appearances: then even A549/B577 
though it is reason, it must nevertheless exhibit an empirical character, 
because every cause presupposes a rule according to which certain appearances 
follow as effects, and every rule requires a uniformity in its 
effects, grounding the concept of a cause (as a faculty), which, insofar as 
it must come to light from mere appearances, we could call the empirical 
character, which is constant, while its effects appear in alterable 
shapes, according to the differences among the conditions that accompany 
and in part limit it. 

Thus every human being has an empirical character for his power of 
choice, which is nothing other than a certain causality of his reason, insofar 
as in its effects in appearance this reason exhibits a rule, in accordance 
with which one could deriveb the rational grounds and the actions 
themselves according to their kind and degree, and estimateC the subjective 
principlesd of his power of choice. Because this empirical character 
itself must be drawn from appearances as effect, and from the rule 
which experience provides, all the actions of the human being in appearance 
are determined in accord with the order of nature by his empirical 
character and the other cooperating causes; and if we could 
investigate all the appearances of his power of choice down to their 
basis, then there would be no human action that we could not predict A5 sol B 578 
with certainty, and recognize as necessary given its preceding conditions. 
Thus in regard to this empirical character there is no freedom, 
and according to this character we can consider the human being solely 

a Ansehen 
b abnehmen 
, beurtheilen 
d Principien 
541 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. II 

by observing, and, as happens in anthropology, by trying to investigate 
the moving causes of his actions physiologically. 

But if we consider the very same actions in relation to reason, not, to 
be sure, in relation to speculative reason, in order to explain them as 
regards their origin, but insofar as reason is the cause of producing 
them by themselves -in a word, if we compare them with reason in a 
practical respect -then we find a rule and order that is entirely other 
than the natural order. For perhaps everything that has happened in 
the course of nature, and on empirical grounds inevitably had to happen, 
nevertheless ought not to have happened. At times, however, we 
find, or at least believe we have found, that the ideas of reason have actually 
proved their causality in regard to the actions of human beings as 
appearances, and that therefore these actions have occurreda not 
through empirical causes, no, but because they were determined by 
grounds of reason. 

A55I/B 579 
Suppose now that one could say reason has causality in regard to appearance; 
could reason's action then be called free even though in its 
empirical character (in the mode of sense) b it is all precisely determined 
and necessary? The empirical character is once again determined in the 
intelligible character (in the mode of thought)/ We are not acquainted 
with the latter, but it is indicated through appearances, which really give 
only the mode of sense (the empirical character) for immediate cognition.* 
Now the action, insofar as it is to be attributed to the mode of 
thought as its cause, nevertheless does not follow from it in accord with 
empirical laws, i.e., in such a way that it is preceded by the conditions 
of pure reason, but only their effects in the appearance of inner sense 
precede it. Pure reason, as a merely intelligible faculty, is not subject to 
the form of time, and hence not subject to the conditions of the temporal 
sequence. The causality of reason in the intelligible character 
does not arise or start working at a certain time in producing an effect. 
A552I B 580 For then it would itself be subject to the natural law of appearances, to 
the extent that this law determines causal series in time, and its causal-

A551 IB 579 * The real morality of actions (their merit and guilt), even that of our own conduct, 
therefore remains entirely hidden from us. Our imputations can be referred 
only to the empirical character. How much of it is to be ascribed to 
mere nature and innocent defects of temperament or to its happy constitution 
(merita Jortunae)d this no one can discover,' and hence no one can judge it with 
complete justice.

Section IX. On the empirical use of the regulative principle 
ity would then be nature and not freedom. Thus we could say that if 
reason can have causality in regard to appearances, then it is a faculty 
through which the sensible condition of an empirical series of effects 
first begins. For the condition that lies in reason is not sensible and does 
not itself begin. Accordingly, there takes place here what we did not 
find in any empirical series: that the condition of a successive series of 
occurrences could itself be empirically unconditioned. For here the 
condition is outside the series of appearances (in the intelligible) and 
hence not subject to any sensible condition or to any determination of 
time through any passing cause. 
Nevertheless, this very same cause in another relation also belongs to 
the series of appearances. The human being himself is an appearance. 
His power of choice has an empirical character, which is the (empirical) 
cause of all his actions. There is not one of these conditions determining 
human beings according to this character which is not contained in 
the series of natural effects and does not obey the laws of nature according 
to which no empirically unconditioned causality is present 
among the things that happen in time. Hence no given action (since it 
can be perceived only as appearance) can begin absolutely from itself. A553/B581 
But of reason one cannot say that before the state in which it determines 
the power of choice, another state precedes in which this state itself 
is determined. For since reason itself is not an appearance and is not 
subject at all to any conditions of sensibility, no temporal sequence 
takes place in it even as to its causality, and thus the dynamical law of 
nature, which determines the temporal sequence according to rules, 
cannot be applied to it. 
Reason is thus the persisting condition of all voluntary actions under 
which the human being appears. Even before it happens, every one of 
these actions is determined beforehand in the empirical character of the 
human being. In regard to the intelligible character, of which the empirical 
one is only the sensible schema, no before or after applies, and 
every action, irrespective of the temporal relation in which it stands to 
other appearances, is the immediate effect of the intelligible character 
of pure reason; reason therefore acts freely, without being determined 
dynamically by external or internal grounds temporally preceding it in 
the chain of natural causes, and this freedom of reason can not only be 
regarded negatively, as independence from empirical conditions (for 
then the faculty of reason would cease to be a cause of appearances), but 
also indicated positively by a faculty of beginning a series of occur-A5 54/ B 582 
rences from itself, in such a way that in reason itself nothing begins, but 
as the unconditioned condition of every voluntary action, it allows of no 
condition prior to it in time, whereas its effect begins in the series of appearances, 
but can never constitute an absolutely first beginning in this 
senes. 
543 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. II 

In order to clarify the regulative principlea of reason through an example 
of its empirical use -not in order to confirm it (for such proofs 
are unworkable for transcendental propositions) -one may take a voluntary 
action, e.g. a malicious lie, through which a person b has brought 
about a certain confusion in society; and one may first investigate its 
moving causes, through which it arose, judging on that basis how the lie 
and its consequences could bee imputed to the person. With this first intent 
one goes into the sources of the person's empirical character, seeking 
them in a bad upbringing, bad company, and also finding them in 
the wickedness of a natural temperd insensitive to shame, partly in carelessness 
and thoughtlessness; in so doing one does not leave out of 
account the occasioning causes. In all this one proceeds as with any investigation 
in the series of determining causes for a given natural effect. 


A555/B 583 Now even if one believes the action to be determined by these causes, 
one nonetheless blames the agent, and not on account of his unhappy 
natural temper, not on account of the circumstances influencing him, 
not even on account of the life he has led previously; for one presupposes 
that it can be entirely set aside how that life was constituted, and 
that the series of conditions that transpired might not have been, but 
rather that this deed could be regarded as entirely unconditioned in regard 
to the previous state, as though with that act the agent had started' 
a series of consequences entirely from himself. This blame is grounded 
on the law of reason, which regards reason as a cause that, regardless of 
all the empirical conditions just named, could have and ought to have 
determined the conduct of the person to be other than it is. And indeed 
one regards the causality of reason not as a mere concurrence with 
other causes, e but as complete in itself, even if sensuous incentives were 
not for it but were indeed entirely against it; the action is ascribed to the 
agent's intelligible character: now, in the moment when he lies, it is entirely 
his fault; hence reason, regardless of all empirical conditions of 
the deed, is fully free, and this deed is to be attributed entirely to its failure 
to actf 
In this judgment of imputation, it is easy to see that one has the 
thoughts that reason is not affected at all by that sensibility, that it does

Section IX. On the empirical use of the regulative principle 
not alter (even if its appearances, namely the way in which it exhibits its A556/B 584 
effects, do alter), that in it no state precedes that determines the following 
one, and hence that reason does not belong at all in the series of 
sensible conditions which make appearances necessary in accordance 
with natural laws. It, reason, is present to all the actions of human beings 
in all conditions of time, and is one and the same, but it is not itself 
in time, and never enters into any new state in which it previously 
was not; in regard to a new state, reason is determining but not determinable. 
Therefore one cannot ask: Why has reason not determined 
itself otherwise? But only: Why has it not determined appearances 
otherwise through its causality? But no answer to this is possible. For 
another intelligible character would have given another empirical one; 
and if we say that regardless of the entire course of life he has led up to 
that point, the agent could still have refrained fromo the lie, then this 
signifies only that it stands immediately under the powerb of reason, and 
in its causality reason is not subject to any conditions of appearance or 
of the temporal series; the difference in time might be a chief difference 
in appearances respecting their relations to one another, since these are 
not things in themselves and hence not causes in themselves, but it 
makes no difference to action in its relation to reason. 
Thus in the judgment of free actions, in regard to their causality, we A557/B 585 
can get only as far as the intelligible cause, but we cannot get beyond 
it; we can knowc that actions could be free, i.e., that they could be determined 
independently of sensibility, and in that way that they could 
be the sensibly unconditioned condition of appearances. But why the 
intelligible character gives us exactly these appearances and this empirical 
character under the circumstances before us, to answer this surpasses 
every faculty of our reason, indeed it surpasses the authority of 
our reason even to ask it; it is as if one were to ask why the transcendental 
object of our outer sensible intuition gives precisely only the intuition 
of space and not some other one. Yet the problem which we had 
to solve does not obligate us to answer these questions, for it was only 
this: Do freedom and natural necessity in one and the same action contradict 
each other? And this we have answered sufficiently when we 
showed that since in freedom a relation is possible to conditions of a 
kind entirely different from those in natural necessity, the law of the latter 
does not affect the former; hence each is independent of the other, 
and can take place without being disturbed by the other.

It should be noted that here we have not been trying to establish the 

A 5 58/ B 586 reality of freedom, as a faculty that contains the causes of appearance 
in our world of sense. For apart from the fact that this would not have 
been any sort of transcendental investigation having to do merely with 
concepts, it could not have succeeded, since from experience we can 
never infer something that does not have to be thought in accord with 
the laws of experience. Further, we have not even tried to prove the 
possibility of freedom; for this would not have succeeded either, because 
from mere concepts a prioriwe cannot cognize anything about the 
possibility of any real ground or any causality. Freedom is treated here 
only as a transcendental idea, through which reason thinks of the series 
of conditions in appearance starting absolutely through what is sensibly 
unconditioned, but thereby involves itself in an antinomy following its 
own laws, which it prescribes for the empirical use of the understanding. 
[To show] that this antinomy rests on a mere illusion, and that nature 
at least does not conflict with causality through freedom -that 
was the one single thing we could accomplish, and it alone was our sole

In the preceding number we considered the changes in the world of 
sense in their dynamical series, where each is subordinated to another 
as its cause. Now this series of states serves only to lead us to an existence 
that could be the highest condition of everything alterable, 
namely to the necessary being. Here we deal not with unconditioned 
causality, but with the unconditioned existence of the substance itself. 
Thus the series we have before us is really only a series of concepts and 
not of intuitions, insofar as one intuition is the condition of another. 

One easily sees, however, that since everything in the sum total of appearances 
is alterable, hence conditioned in its existence, there could 
not be any unconditioned member anywhere in the series of dependent 
existences whose existence would be absolutely necessary; and hence 
that if appearances were things in themselves, and so just for this reason 
their condition always belong to one and the same series of intu


A56o/B 588 itions, then a necessary being could never occur as a condition of the 
existence of appearances in the world of sense. 
But the dynamic regress has in itself this peculiar feature, dis tin


a 


Kant notes: "Morality is that which, if it is correct, positively presupposes freedom. 
"If the former is true, then freedom is proved." (E CLXXVI, p. 52; 23 :42)

Section IX. On the empirical use of the regulative principle 

guishing it from the mathematical one: that since the latter really has to 
do only with the combination of parts into a whole, or with the dissolution 
of a whole into its parts, the conditions of this series always have 
to be seen as parts of it, hence as being of the same lpnd, and consequently 
as appearances, whereas in the former regress, which has to do 
not with the possibility of an unconditioned whole or an unconditioned 
part of a given whole but with the derivation of a state from its cause or 
of the contingent existence of a substance itself from the necessary existence 
of one, the condition need not necessarily constitute one empirical 
series along with the conditioned. 

Therefore there remains only one way out of the apparent antinomy 
lying before us: since, namely, both the conflicting propositions can be 
true at the same time in a different relation in such a way that all things 
in the world of sense are completely contingent, hence having always 
only an empirically conditioned existence, there nevertheless occurs a 
non-empirical condition of the entire series, i.e., an unconditionally 
necessary being. For this, as an intelligible condition, would not belong 
to the series as a member of it (not even as the supreme member) at all, 
and would not make any member of the series unconditionally neces-A56 1/ B 589 
sary, but it would leave the entire world of sense to the empirically conditioned 
existence which runs through all its members. Hence this way 
of grounding an unconditioned existence would be distinguished from 
the empirically unconditioned causality (of freedom) in the previous article 
in that in the case of freedom, the thing itself as cause (substantia 
phaenomenon)a would nevertheless belong to the series of conditions, 
and only its causality would be thought as intelligible, but here the 
necessary being would have to be thought of as entirely outside the series 
of the world of sense (as an ens extramundanum)b and merely intelligible; 
this is the only way of preventing it from being subjected to the 
law of the contingency and dependence of all appearances.84 

The regulative principlec of reason in regard to this problem of 
ours is therefore that everything in the world of sense has an empirically 
conditioned existence, and there cannot be an unconditioned necessity 
in it in regard to any of its properties, that there is no member of the 
series such that one does not always expect an empirical condition for it 
in a possible experience, and for which one must seek for such a condition 
as far as one can, and nothing justifies us in deriving any existence 
from a condition outside the empirical series, or indeed in taking anything 
in the series itself to be absolutely independent and self-sufficient; 
nevertheless, this is not in any way to deny that the entire series could B562 / B 590

be grounded in some intelligible being (which is therefore free of every 
empirical condition, containing, rather, the ground of the possibility of 
all these appearances). 


But here it is not at all the intenta to prove the unconditionally necessary 
existence of any being, or even to ground the possibility of a 
merely intelligible condition of existence in the world of sense on it; 
rather, just as we limit reason so that it does not abandon the thread of 
the empirical conditions, and stray into transcendent grounds of explanation 
which do not admit of any exhibition in concreto, so on the 
other side we limit the law of the merely empirical use of the understanding, 
so that it does not decide the possibility of things in general, 
nor declare the intelligible, even though it is not to be used by us in explaining 
appearances, to be impossible. Thus it has been shown only 
that the thoroughgoing contingency of all natural things and all of nature's 
(empirical) conditions can very well coexist with the option alb 
presupposition of a necessary, even though merely intelligible condition, 
and thus that there is no true contradiction between these assertions, 
hence they can both be true. Such an absolutely necessary being 
of the understanding may always be impossible in itself, yet this can by 

AS63/BiS91 no means be inferred from the universal contingency and dependence 
of everything belonging to the world of sense, nor can it be inferred 
from the principle' that we should not stop with any individual member 
of it and appeal to a cause outside the world. Reason goes its way in its 
empirical use, and a special way in a transcendental use. 
The world of sense contains nothing but appearances, but these are 
mere representations, which are once again always sensibly conditioned, 
and, since here we never have to do with things in themselves as 
our objects, it is no wonder that we are never justified in making a leap 
from one member of the empirical series, whatever it might be, outside 
the connections of sensibility, just as if these members were things in 
themselves existing outside their transcendental ground, which one 
might leave behind in seeking the cause of their existence outside themselves; 
of course that would have to happen with contingent things, but 
not with mere representations of things, whose contingency itself is 
only a phenomenon, and can lead to no other regress but the one determining 
phenomena, i.e., the one which is empirical. But to think of 
an intelligible ground for appearances, i.e., for the world of sense, and 
of appearances freed from the contingency of the world of sense, is opposed 
neither to the unlimited empirical regress in the series of ap


􀝜5641 B 592 pearances nor to their thoroughgoing contingency. But that is also the

Section IX. On the empirical use of the regulative principle 

only thing we had to do to remove the apparent antinomy, and it could 
be done only in this way. For if for every conditioned the condition is 
always sensible (in its existence), and therefore something belonging to 
the series, then the condition is itself once again conditioned (as the antithesis 
of the fourth antinomy shows). Thus either reason, in demanding 
the unconditioned, must remain in conflict with itself, or else this 
unconditioned must be posited outside the series in the intelligible 
realm, where necessity is neither demanded nor permitted by any empirical 
condition, and thus in respect of appearances it is unconditionally 
necessary. 

The empirical use of reason (in regard to the conditions of existence 
in the world of sense) is not affected by the admission of a merely intelligible 
being; rather it proceeds, according to the principle a of thoroughgoing 
contingency, from empirical conditions to higher ones, 
which are likewise always empirical. But just as little does this regulative 
principle exclude the assumption of an intelligible cause which is 
not in the series, when it is a matter of the pure use of reason (in regard 
to its ends). For here the intelligible cause signifies only the ground, for 
us transcendental and unknown, of the possibility of the sensible series 
in general, whose existence, independent of all conditions of the latter 
and unconditionally necessary in regard to it, is not at all opposed to the 
unbounded contingency of the former, and is therefore also not op-A565 / B 593 
posed to the regress, which is never ended, in the series of empirical 
conditions. 


Concluding remark 
to the entire antinomy of pure reason. 

As long as we, with our concepts of reason, have as our object merely 
the totality of the conditions in the world of sense, and what service reason 
can perform in respect of them, our ideas are transcendental but 
still cosmological. But as soon as we posit the unconditioned (which is 
what is really at issue) in that which lies outside the sensible world, and 
hence in that which is outside all possible experience, then the ideas 
come to be transcendent; they do not serve merely to complete the 
empirical use of reason (which always remains an idea, never to be completely 
carried out, but nevertheless to be followed), rather they separate 
themselves entirely from it and make themselves into objects whose 
matter is not drawn from experience, and whose objective reality rests 
not on the completion of the empirical series but on pure concepts a 
priori. Such transcendent ideas have a merely intelligible object, which 

a Princip 


549 



Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. II 

one is of course allowed to admit as a transcendental object,a but about 
which one knows nothing; but for the assumption of such an object, in 
thinking it as a thing determinable by its distinguishing and inner pred-
A566/ B 594 icates, we have on our side neither grounds of its possibility (since it is 
independent of all concepts of experience) nor the least justification, 
and so it is a mere thought-entity. Nevertheless, among the cosmological 
ideas, the one occasioning the fourth antinomy presses us to venture 
so far as to take this step. For the existence of appearances, not 
grounded in the least within itself but always conditioned, demands that 
we look around us for something different from all appearances, hence 
for an intelligible object, with which this contingency would stop. But 
if we once take the liberty of assuming a reality subsisting by itselfb outside 
the entire field of sensibility, then appearances are regardedC only 
as contingent ways intelligible objects are represented by beings who 
are themselves intelligences; and because of this, nothing is left for us 
but the analogy by which we utilize concepts of experience in making 
some sort of concept of intelligible things, with which we have not the 
least acquaintance as they are in themselves. Because we cannot become 
acquainted with the contingent except through experience, but 
are here concerned with things which are not to be objects of experience 
at all, we have to derive our acquaintance d with them from what is 
necessary in itself, from pure concepts of things in generaLe Thus the 
first step we take beyond the sensible world compels us, in acquiring 

A567 / B 595 new knowledge! to begin with the investigation of the absolutely necessary 
being, and to derive from the concepts of it the concepts of all 
things insofar as they are merely intelligible; we will set about this attempt 
in the following chapter.

The ideal of pure reason8s 
Section One 
The ideal in general. 

We have seen above that no objects at all can be represented through 
pure concepts of the understanding without any conditions of sensibility, 
because the conditions for the objective reality of these concepts 
are lacking, and nothing is encountered in them except the pure form 
of thinking. Nevertheless they can be exhibited in concreto if one applies 
them to appearances; for in the latter they have the proper material for 
a concept of experience, which is nothing but a concept of the understanding 
in concreto. Ideas, however, are still more remote from objective 
reality than categories; for no appearance can be found in which 
they may be represented in concreto. They contain a certain completeness 
that no possible empirical cognition ever achieves, and with them A568/B 596 
reason has a systematic unity only in the sense that the empirically possible 
unity seeks to approach it without ever completely reaching it. 

But something that seems to be even further removed from objective 
reality than the idea is what I call the ideal, by which I understand the 
idea not merely in concreto but in individuo, i.e., as an individual thing 
which is determinable, or even determined, through the idea alone. 

Humanity in its entire perfection contains not only the extension of 
all those properties belonging essentially to this nature and constituting 
our concept of it to the point of complete congruence with its ends, 
which would be our idea of perfect humanity, but also everything besides 
this concept that belongs to the thoroughgoing determination of 
the idea; for out of each [pair of] opposed predicates only a single one 
can be suited to the idea of the perfect human being. What is an ideal 
to us, was to Plato an idea in the divine understanding,86 an individual 
object in that understanding's pure intuition, the most perfect thing 
of each species of possible beings and the original ground of all its 
copies in appearance. 

551 



Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. III 

A569/ B 597 Without venturing to climb as high as that, however, we have to 
admit that human reason contains not only ideas but also ideals, which 
do not, to be sure, have a creative power like the Platonic idea, but still 
have practical power (as regulative principles)a grounding the possibility 
of the perfection of certain actions. Moral concepts are not entirely 
pure concepts of reason, because they are grounded on something empirical 
(pleasure or displeasure). But in regard to the principle b through 
which reason places limits on a freedom which is in itself lawless, they 
can nevertheless serve quite well (if one attends merely to their form) as 
examples of pure concepts of reason. Virtue, and with it human wisdom 
in its entire purity, are ideas. But the sage (of the Stoics) is an ideal, i.e., 
a human being who exists merely in thoughts, but who is fully congruent 
with the idea of wisdom. Thus just as the idea gives the rule, so the 
ideal in such a case serves as the original imageC for the thoroughgoing 
determination of the copy; and we have in us no other standard for 
our actions than the conduct of this divine human being, with which we 
can compare ourselves, judgingd ourselves and thereby improving ourselves, 
even though we can never reach the standard. These ideals, even 
though one may never concede them objective reality (existence), are 
nevertheless not to be regarded as mere figments of the brain; rather, 
they provide an indispensable standard for reason, which needs the con-

A570/ B 598 cept of that which is entirely complete in its kind, in order to assess and 
measure the degree and the defects of what is incomplete. But to try to 
realize the ideal in an example, i.e., in appearance, such as that of the 
sage in a novel, is not feasible, and even has about it something nonsensical 
and not very edifying, since the natural limits which constantly 
impair the completeness in the idea render impossible every illusion in 
such an attempt, and thereby render even what is good in the idea suspect 
by making it similar to a mere fiction. 


That is how it is with the ideal of reason, which always rests on determinate 
concepts and must serve as a rule and an original image, whether 
for following or for judging. It is entirely otherwise with the creatures of 
imagination, of which no one can give an explanation or an intelligible 
concept; they are, as it were, monograms, individual traits, though not 
determined through any assignable rule, constituting more a wavering 
sketch, as it were, which mediates between various appearances, than a 
determinate image, such as what painters and physiognomists say they 
have in their heads, and is supposed to be an incommunicable silhouette 
of their products or even of their critical judgments. These images can,

supposed to be the unattainable model for possible empirical intuitions, 
and yet at the same time they are not supposed to provide any rule ca-A 57 1/B 579

The aim of reason with its ideal is, on the contrary, a thoroughgoing 
determination in accordance with a priori rules; hence it thinks for itself 
an object that is to be thoroughly determinable in accordance with 
principles, a even though the sufficient conditions for this are absent 
from experience, and thus the concept itself is transcendent.b 
Chapter Three 
Section Two 
The transcendental ideal87 
(Prototypon transcendentale) 
Every concept, in regard to what is not contained in it, is indeterminate, 
and stands under the principle of determinability: that of every 
two contradictorily opposed predicates only one can apply to it, which 
rests on the principle of contradiction C and hence is a merely logical 
principle,d which abstracts from every content of cognition, and has in 
view nothing but the logical form of cognition. 
Every thing, however, as to its possibility, further stands under 
the principle of thoroughgoing determination; according to which, 
among all possible predicates of things, insofar as they are compared A572/B600 
with their opposites, one must apply to it.88 This does not rest merely 
on the principle of contradiction, for besides considering every thing in 
relatione to two contradictorily conflicting predicates, it considers every 
thing further in relation! to the whole of possibility, as the sum total 
of all predicates of things in general; and by presupposing that as a condition 
a priori, it represents every thing as deriving its own possibility 
a Principien 
b Kant adds: "Consequent way of thinking. We have proved all objects of experience only 
as appearances. There must, therefore, be something actual besides the objects of experience. 
No speculative way of cognition can attain to determining this something, because 
the latter is a mere form of thoughts, which with us are sensible; and the existence 
of that which we think through reason would not be able to be proved from mere concepts. 
But freedom in the practical furnishes an actual law of causality, which is not empirical, 
and therefore is the actuality which, concerning its quality, not only proves the 
actuality of something extrasensible but also determines it. The [a final word appears to 
be either 'unity' (Einheit) or 'insight' (Einsicht)] .

from the share it has in that whole of possibility. * The principle of thoroughgoing 
determination thus deals with the content and not merely 
the logical form. It is the principle of the synthesis of all predicates 
which are to make up the complete concept of a thing, and not merely 
of the analytical representation, through one of two opposed predicates; 
and it contains a transcendental presupposition, namely that of the ma


A573/B6OI terial of all possibility, which is supposed to contain a priori the data for 
the particular possibility of every thing. 
The proposition Everything existing is thoroughly determined 
signifies not only that of every given pair of opposed predicates, but also 
of every pair of possible predicates, one of them must always apply to it; 
through this proposition predicates are not merely compared logically 
with one another, but the thing itself is compared transcendentally with 
the sum total of all possible predicates. What it means is that in order to 
cognize a thing completely one has to cognize everything possible and 
determine the thing through it, whether affirmatively or negatively. 
Thoroughgoing determination is consequently a concept that we can 
never exhibit in concreto in its totality, and thus it is grounded on an idea 
which has its seat solely in reason, which prescribes to the understanding 
the rule of its complete use. 

Now although this idea of the sum total of all possibility, insofar as 
it grounds every thing as the condition of its thoroughgoing determination 
in regard to the predicates which may constitute the thing, is itself 
still indeterminate, and through it we think nothing beyond a sum 
total of all possible predicates in general, we nevertheless find on closer 
investigation that this idea, as an original concept, excludes a multiplicity 
of predicates, which, as derived through others, are already given, Or 

A574/B602 cannot coexist with one another; and that it refines itself to a concept 
thoroughly determined a priori, and thereby becomes the concept of an 
individual object that is thoroughly determined merely through the 
idea, and then must be called an ideal of pure reason. 

If we consider all possible predicates not merely logically but transcendentally, 
i.e., as to their content which can be thought in them a 

A572/B6oo * Thus through this principle every thing is related to a common correlate, 
namely the collective possibility, which, if it (i.e., the matter for all possible 
predicates) were present in the idea of an individual thing, would prove an 
affinity of everything possible through the identity of the ground of its thoroughgoing 
determination. The determinability of every single concept is 
the universality (universalitas) of the principle of excluded middle between 
two opposed predicates; but the determination of a thing is subordinated to 
the allness (universitas) or the sum total of all possible predicates. 

" Principium 

554 



Section II. On the transcendental ideal 
priori, then we find that through some of them a being is represented, 
and through others a mere non-being. Logical negation, which is indicated 
solely by the little word "not," is never properly attached to a 
concept, but rather only to its relationa to another concept in a judgment, 
and therefore it is far from sufficient to designate a concept in 
regard to its content. The expression "non-mortal" cannot at all give 
the cognition that a mere non-being is represented in the object, but 
leaves all content unaffected. A transcendental negation, on the contrary, 
signifies non-being in itself, and is opposed to transcendental 
affirmation, which is a Something,b the concept of which in itself already 
expresses a being, and hence it is called reality (thinghood),c because 
through it alone, and only so far as it reaches, are objects 
Something (things); the opposed negation, on the contrary, signifies a 
mere lack, and where this alone is thought, the removal of every thing A575/B603 
is represented. 
Now no one can think a negation determinately without grounding 
it on the opposed affirmation. The person blind from birth cannot form 
the least representation of darkness, because he has no representation 
of light; the savage has no acquaintance with poverty, because he has 
none with prosperity.* The ignorant person has no concept of his ignorance, 
because he has none of science, etc. All concepts of negations are 
thus derivative, and the realities contain the data, the material, so to 
speak, or the transcendental content, for the possibility and the thoroughgoing 
determination of all things. 
Thus if the thoroughgoing determination in our reason is grounded 
on a transcendental substratum, which contains as it were the entire 
storehouse of material from which all possible predicates of things can 
be taken, then this substratum is nothing other than the idea of an All 
of reality (omnitudo realitatis). All true negations are then nothing but A5761B604 
limits, which they could not be called unless they were grounded in the 
unlimited (the All). 
* The observations and calculations of astronomers have taught us much that is A 575/ B 603 
worthy of admiration, but most important, probably, is that they have exposed 
for us the abyss of our ignorance, which without this infonnationd human 
reason could never have imagined' to be so great; reflection on this ignorance 
has to produce a great alteration in the determination of the final aims! of the 
use of our reason.

Through this possession of all reality, however, there is also represented 
the concept of a thing in itself which is thoroughly determined, 
and the concept of an ens realissimuma is the concept of an individual 
being, because of all possible opposed predicates, one, namely that 
which belongs absolutely to being, is encountered in its determination. 
Thus it is a transcendental ideal which is the ground of the thoroughgoing 
determination that is necessarily encountered in everything existing, 
and which constitutes the supreme and complete material condition 
of its possibility, to which all thinking of objects in general must, as regards 
the content of that thinking, be traced back. It is, however, also 
the one single genuine ideal of which human reason is capable, because 
only in this one single case is an -in itself universal -concept of one 
thing thoroughly determined through itself, and cognized as the representation 
of an individual. 


The logical determination of a concept through reason rests on a dis


junctive syllogism, in which the major premise contains a logical division 

(the division of the sphere of a general concept), the minor premise re-

A 577/B 605 stricts this sphere to one part, and the conclusion determines the concept 
through this part. The general concept of a reality in general cannot 
be divided up a priori, because apart from experience one is acquainted 
with no determinate species of reality that would be contained under 
that genus. Thus the transcendental major premise for the thoroughgoing 
determination of all things is none other than the representation of 
the sum total of all reality, a concept that comprehends all predicates as 
regards their transcendental content not merely under itself, butwithin 
itself; and the thoroughgoing determination of every thing rests on the 
limitation of this All of reality, in that some of it is ascribed to the thing 
and the rest excluded from it, which agrees with the "either/or" of the 
disjunctive major premise and the determination of the object through 
one of the members of this division in the minor premise.b The use of 
reason through which it grounds its determination of all things in the 
transcendental ideal is, accordingly, analogous to its procedure in disjunctive 
syllogisms; that was the proposition on which I above89 
grounded the systematic division of all transcendental ideas, according 
to which they were generated parallel and corresponding to the three 
kinds of syllogisms. 


a "most real being"; Kant declines the Latin phrase in the genitive. 

b Kant adds in his copy of the first edition: "the principle [Princip] of determination 
says only that if a concept of a thing is to be determined, it could be determined 
only through one of the two: A or non-A. The principle [Satz] of thoroughgoing 
determination says that every thing (as existing, i.e., in respect of everything 
possible) is determined in respect of all possible predicates." (E CLXXIX, p. 53; 
23:42) 

556 



Section II. On the transcendental ideal 
It is self-evident that with this aim namely, 
solely that of representing 
the necessary thoroughgoing determination of things -reason does 
not presuppose the existence of a being conforming to the ideal, but A578/B606 
only the idea of such a being, in order to derive from an unconditioned 
totality of thoroughgoing determination the conditioned totality, i.e., 
that of the limited. For reason the ideal is thus the original image (prototypon) 
of all things, which all together, as defective copies (ectypa), take 
from it the matter for their possibility, and yet although they approach 
more or less nearly to it, they always fall infinitely short of reaching it. 
Thus all the possibility of things (as regards the synthesis of the manifold 
of their content) is regarded as derivative, and only that which includes 
all reality in it is regarded as original. For all negations (which 
are the sole predicates through which everything else is to be distinguished 
from the most real being) are mere limitations of a greater and 
finally of the highest reality; hence they presuppose it, and as regards 
their content they are merely derived from it. All manifoldness of things 
is only so many different ways of limiting the concept of the highest reality, 
which is their common substratum, just as all figures are possible 
only as different ways oflimiting infinite space. Hence the object of reason's 
ideal, which is to be found only in reason, is also called the original 
being (ens originarium); because it has nothing above itself it is 
called the highest being (ens summum), and because everything else, as 
conditioned, stands under it, it is called the being of all beings (ens en-A 5791 B 607 
tium). Yet all of this does not signify the objective relation of an actual 
object to other things, but only that of an idea to concepts, and as to 
the existence of a being of such preeminent excellence it leaves us in 
complete ignorance. 
Because one also cannot say that an original being consists in many 
derivative beings, since each of the latter presupposes the former and so 
cannot constitute it, the ideal of the original being must also be thought 
of as simple. 
The derivation of all other possibility from this original being, strictly 
speaking, also cannot be regarded as a limitation of its highest reality 
and as a division, as it were, of it; for then the original being would be 
regarded as a mere aggregate of derivative beings, which, according to 
the above, is impossible, even though we represented it in such a way at 
the beginning in our first crude outline.a Rather, the highest reality 
would ground the possibility of all things as a ground and not as a sum 
total; and the manifoldness of the former rests not on the limitation of 
the original being itself, but on its complete consequences; to which our 
whole sensibility, including all reality in appearance, would then belong, 
which cannot belong to the idea of a highest being as an ingredient.

A 5801 B 608 Now if we pursue this idea of ours so far as to hypostatize it, then we 
will be able to determine the original being through the mere concept 
of the highest reality as a being that is singular,a simple, all-sufficient, 
eternal, etc., in a word, we will be able to determine it in its unconditioned 
completeness through all predications.b The concept of such a 
being is that of God thought of in a transcendental sense, and thus the 
ideal of pure reason is the object of a transcendental theology, just as I 
have introduced it above.90 
Meanwhile this use of the transcendental idea would already be overstepping 
the boundaries of its vocationC and its permissibility. For on it, 
as the concept of all reality, reason only grounded the thoroughgoing 
determination of things in general, without demanding that this reality 
should be given objectively, and itself constitute a thing. This latter is a 
mere fiction, through which we encompass and realize the manifold of 
our idea in an ideal, as a particular being; for this we have no warrant, 
not even for directly assuming the possibility of such a hypothesis, just 
as none of the consequences flowing from such an ideal have any bearing, 
nor even the least influence, on the thoroughgoing determination 
of things in general, on behalf of which alone the idea was necessary. 

As8r/B609 It is not enough to describe the procedure of our reason and its dialectic; 
one must also seek to discover its sources, so as to be able to explain 
this illusion itself, as a phenomenon of the understanding; for the 
ideal we are talking about is grounded on a natural and not a merely arbitrary 
idea. Therefore I ask: How does reason come to regard all the 
possibility of things as derived from a single possibility, namely that of 
the highest reality, and even to presuppose these possibilities as contained 
in a particular original being? 
The answer suggests itself on the basis of the discussions of the Transcendental 
Analytic themselves. The possibility of objects of sense is a 
relationd of these objects to our thought, in which something (namely, 
the empirical form) can be thought a priori, but what constitutes the material, 
the reality in appearance (corresponding to sensation) has to be 
given; without that nothing at all could be thought and hence no possibility 
could be represented.91 Now an object of sense can be thoroughly 
determined only if it is compared with all the predicates of appearance 
and is represented through them either affirmatively or negatively. But 
because that which constitutes the thing itself (in appearance), namely 
the real, has to be given, without which it could not be thought at all, but 

As82/B6ro that in which the real in all appearances is given is the one all-encom

Section III. On the proofs of the existence of a highest being 

passing experience, the material for the possibility of all objects of sense 
has to be presupposed as given in one sum total; and all possibility of empirical 
objects, their difference from one another and their thoroughgoing 
determination, can rest only on the limitation of this sum total. Now 
in fact no other objects except those of sense can be given to us, and they 
can be given nowhere except in the context of a possible experience; consequently, 
nothing is an object for us unless it presupposes the sum total 
of all empirical reality as condition of its possibility.92 In accordance with 
a natural illusion, we regard as a principle that must hold of all things in 
general that which properly holds only of those which are given as objects 
of our senses. Consequently, through the omission of this limitation 
we will take the empirical principle a of our concepts of the possibility of 
things as appearances to be a transcendental principle b of the possibility 
of things in general. 

That we subsequently hypostatize this idea of the sum total of all reality, 
however, comes about because we dialectically transform the distributive 
unity of the use of the understanding in experience, into the 
collective unity of a whole of experience; and from this whole of appearance 
we think up an individual thing containing in itself all empirical 
reality,93 which then -by means of the transcendental subreption A583 / B 661 
we have already thought -is confused with the concept of a thing that 
stands at the summit of the possibility of all things, providing the real 
conditions for their thoroughgoing determination.*

The grounds of proof of speculative reason for 
inferring the existence of a highest being. 

In spite of its urgent need to presuppose something that the understanding 
could take as the complete ground for the thoroughgoing determination 
of its concepts, reason notices the ideal and merely fictive 

* This ideal of the supremely real being, even though it is a mere representation, 
is first realized, i.e., made into an object,' then hypostatized, and finally, as we 
will presently allege, through a natural progress of reason in the completion of 
unity, it is even personified;94 for the regulative unity of experience rests not 
on appearances themselves (of sensibility alone), but on the connection of its 
manifold by understanding (in one apperception); hence the unity of the 
highest reality and the thoroughgoing determinability (possibility) of all things 
seems to lie in a highest understanding, hence in an intelligence.

character of such a presupposition much too easily to allow itself to be 

A S84/ B 612 persuaded by this alone straightway to assume a mere creature of its own 
thinking to be an actual being, were it not urged from another source to 
seek somewhere for a resting place in the regress from the conditioned, 
which is given, to the unconditioned, which in itself and as regards its 
mere concept is not indeed actually given, but which alone can complete 
series of conditions carried out to their grounds. Now this is the natural 
course taken by every human reason, even the most common, although 
not everyone perseveres in it. It a begins not with concepts, but with 
common experience, and thus grounds itself on something existing. But 
this footingh gives way unless it rests on the immovable rock of the absolutely 
necessary. But this itself floats without a support if there is still 
only empty space outside it and under it, unless it itself fills everything, 
so that no room is left over for any further Why? -i.e., unless it is infinite 
in its reality. 
If something, no matter what, exists, then it must also be conceded 
that something exists necessarily. For the contingent exists only under 
the condition of something else as its cause, and from this the same inference 
holds further all the way to a cause not existing contingently 
and therefore necessarily without condition. That is the argument on 
which reason grounds its progress to the original being.95 

AS8S/B613 Now reason looks around for the concept of a being suited for such 
a privileged existence, as the absolute necessity, yet not in order to infer 
its existence a priori from its concept (for if it were confident of that, 
then it might inquire only among mere concepts, and would not find it 
necessary to take a given existence as its ground), but rather only in 
order to find among all the concepts of possible things that one that has 
nothing within itself conflicting with absolute necessity. For in accordance 
with the first inference, reason takes it as already settled that 
something or other has to exist with absolute necessity. If it can now do 
away with everything that is not compatible with this necessity, except 
for one, then this is the absolutely necessary being, whether one can 
comprehend its necessity, i.e., derive it from its concept alone, or not. 
Now that the concept of which contains within itself the "Because" to 
every "Why?" -that which is in no part or respect defective, that which 
is in all ways sufficient as a condition -seems to be the being suited to 
absolute necessity just because by itself possessing all the conditions for 
everything possible, it itself needs no condition, and is indeed not even 
susceptible of one; consequently, it satisfies the concept of unconditioned 
necessity on at least one point, in which no other concept can 

a Sie, whose referent could grammatically be "reason" (or "every human reason"), but not 


"the natural course."

Section III. On the proofs of the existence of a highest being 

equal it, since every other concept is defective and in need of comple-AS86/B6I4 
tion, not showing in itself any such mark of its independence of all further 
conditions. It is true that from this it still cannot be concluded with 
certainty that what does not contain within itself the highest and in 
every respect complete condition must therefore be conditioned in its 
existence; but then it does not have in itself that single earmark of unconditioned 
existence which gives reason the power to cognize any 
being as unconditioned through a concept a priori. 

Thus among all the concepts of possible things the concept of a being 
having the highest reality would be best suited to the concept of an unconditionally 
necessary being, and even if it does not fully satisfy this 
concept, we still have no other choice, but see ourselves compelled to 
hold to it, because we must not just throw the existence of a necessary 
being to the winds; yet if we concede this existence, then in the entire 
field of possibility we cannot find anything that could make a more 
well-grounded claim to such a privilege in existence.96 


This, therefore, is how the natural course of human reason is constituted. 
First it convinces itself of the existence of some necessary being. 
In this it recognizes an unconditioned existence. Now it seeks for the 
concept of something independent of all conditions, and finds it in that 
which is the sufficient condition for everything else, i.e., in that which A587 / B 61 5 
contains all reality. The All without limits, however, is absolute unity, 
and carries with it the concept of one single being, namely the highest 
being; and thus reason infers that the highest being, as the original 
ground of all things, exists in an absolutely necessary way. 

It cannot be disputed that this concept has a certain cogency a if it is 
a matter of making decisions, that is, if the existence of some necessary 
being is already conceded, and one agrees that one must take sides on 
where one is to place it; for then one can make no more suitable choice 
than -or rather, one has no other choice, but is compelled -to vote for 
the absolute unity of complete reality as the original source of possibility. 
But if nothing impels us to come to a decision, and we would rather 
let this entire matter be tabled until we are compelled to give our approval 
by the full weight of grounds of proof, i.e., if it is merely a matter 
of estimating how much we know about this problem and what we 
merely flatter ourselves that we know -then the above inference does 
not appear to be in anything like the same advantageous shape and 
needs some special favor to make up for the defects in its rightful 
claims. 

For if we let everything stand just as it is here, namely: first, that from 
any given existence (in any case merely my own) there is a valid infer-AS88/B6I6 
ence to the existence of an unconditionally necessary being; second, 

a Griindlichkeit 


561 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. III 

that I have to regard a being that contains all reality, hence all conditions, 
as absolutely unconditioned, and consequently have found in it 
the concept of the thing which is suited for absolute necessity; then 
from this it still cannot be inferred that therefore the concept of a limited 
being, which does not have the highest reality, contradicts absolute 
necessity. For even if in its concept I do not find the unconditioned 
which the All of conditions already carries with it, still it cannot be concluded 
just from this that its existence must be conditioned; just as I 
cannot say in a hypothetical syllogism: 􀝝ere a certain condition (here, 
namely, completeness according to concepts) is not, there too the conditioned 
thing is not. Rather we are still at liberty to count all the remaining 
limited beings equally as absolutely necessary, even though we 
cannot infer their necessity from the universal concept we have of them. 
Looked at in this way, however, this argument has not produced for us 
even the least concept of the properties of a necessary being, and has in 
fact not achieved anything at all. 


Nevertheless there remains to this argument a certain importance 
and high regard of which it cannot straightway be divested simply on 

AS89/B617 account of this objective insufficiency. For suppose there were obligations 
that were entirely correct in the idea of reason but would have no 
real application to us, i.e., would be without any incentives, if a highest 
being were not presupposed who could give effect and emphasis to the 
practical laws; then we would also have an obligation to follow those 
concepts, that even though they may not be objectively sufficient, are 
still preponderant in accordance with the measure of our reason, and in 
comparison with which we recognize nothing better or more convincing. 
The duty to choose would here tip the indecisiveness of speculation 
out of balance through a practical addition; indeed, reason, as the 
most circumspect judge, could not find any justification for itself if, 
under the pressure of urgent causes though with defec􀝞ive insight, its 
judgment were not to follow these grounds, than which we at least 
know none better. 
This argument, although it is in fact transcendental, since it rests on 
the inner insufficiency of the contingent, is yet so simple and natural 
that it is suited to the commonest human understanding as soon as the 
latter is once led to it. One sees things alter, arise, and perish; therefore 
they, or at least their state, must have a cause. About every cause, how-

AS 90 / B 6 I 8 ever, that may be given in experience, the same thing may once again 
be asked. Now where could we more appropriately locate the supreme 
causality than right where the highest causality is, i.e., in that being, 
originally containing within itself what is sufficient for the possible effect, 
whose concept also comes about very easily through the single trait 
of an all-encompassing perfection. This highest cause we then take to 
be absolutely necessary, because we find it absolutely necessary to as

Section III. On the proofs of the existence of a highest being 

cend to it and no ground for going still further beyond it. Therefore 
even through the blindest polytheism in all peoples we see shimmering 
a few sparks of monotheism, to which they have been led not by reflection 
and deep speculation, but only in accordance with a natural course 
of common understanding becoming gradually more intelligible. 

There are only three kinds of proof for the existence of 
God possible from speculative reason. 

All paths on which one may set forth with this aim either begin from 
determinate experience and the special constitution of our world of 
sense knowna through it, and ascend from that by means of laws of 
causality to the highest cause outside the world; or else they are empirically 
grounded on an experience that is only indeterminate, i.e., on 
some existence; or, finally, they abstract from all experience and infer 
the existence of a highest cause entirely a priori from mere concepts. 
The first proof is the physico-theological, the second the cosmolog-A59I/B619 
ical, and the third the ontological proof. There are no more of them, 
and there also cannot be any more. 

r will establish that reason accomplishes just as little on the one path 
(the empirical) as on the other (the transcendental), and that it spreads 
its wings in vain when seeking to rise above the world of sense through 
the mere might of speculation. As to the order in which these species of 
proof have to be presented for examination, however, it will be just the 
reverse of that taken by reason in gradually unfolding itself, and in 
which we have first placed them. For it will be shown that although experience 
has given the occasion for them, it is nevertheless merely the 
transcendental concept of reason that it has set forth for itself that directs 
these strivings and holds up the target in all such attempts. Thus 
I will begin by examining the transcendental proof, and later see what 
the addition of the empirical can do to increase the force of its proof.

From the foregoing one easily sees that the concept of an absolutely 
necessary being is a pure concept of reason, i.e., a mere idea, the objective 
reality of which is far from being proved by the fact that reason 
needs it, since this only points to a certain though unattainable completeness, 
and properly serves more to set boundaries to the under

standing than to extend it toward new objects. But here we find something 
strange and paradoxical, that the inference from a given existence 
in general to some absolutely necessary being seems to be both urgent 
and correct, and yet nevertheless in framing a concept of such a necessity, 
we have all the conditions of the understanding entirely against us. 


In all ages one has talked about the absolutely necessary being, but 
has taken trouble not so much to understand whether and how one 
could so much as think of a thing of this kind as rather to prove its existence. 
Now a nominal definitiona of this concept is quite easy, namely 
that it is something whose non-being is impossible; but through this 

A593/ B 62 lhone becomes no wiser in regard to the conditions that make it necessaryb 
to regard the non-being of a thing as absolutely unthinkable, and 
that are really what one wants to know, namely whether or not through 
this concept we are thinking anything at all. For by means of the word 
unconditional to reject all the conditions that the understanding always 
needs in order to regard something as necessary, is far from 
enough to make intelligible to myself whether through a concept of an 
unconditionally necessary being I am still thinking something or perhaps 
nothing at all. 
Still more: one believed one could explain this concept, which was 
ventured upon merely haphazardly, and that one has finally come to 
take quite for granted through a multiplicity of examples, so that all further 
demands concerning its intelligibility appeared entirely unnecessary. 
Every proposition of geometry, e.g., "a triangle has three angles," 
is absolutely necessary, and in this way one talked about an object lying 
entirely outside the sphere of our understanding as if one understood 
quite well what one meant by this concept. 
All the alleged examples are without exception taken only from judgments, 
but not from things and their existence.' The unconditioned 
necessity of judgments, however, is not an absolute necessity of things.d 
For the absolute necessity of the judgment is only a conditioned neces


A594/B622 sity of the thing, e or of the predicate in the judgment. The above 
proposition does not say that three angles are absolutely necessary, but 
rather that under the condition that a triangle exists (is given), three an-

gles also exist (in it) necessarily. Nevertheless the illusion of this logical 
necessity has proved so powerful that when one has made a concept a 
priori of a thing that was set up so that its existence was comprehended 
within the range of its meaning, one believed one could infer with certainty 
that because existence necessarily pertains to the object" of this 
concept, i.e., under the condition that I posit this thing as given (existing), 
its existence can also be posited necessarily (according to the rule 
of identity), and this being itself, therefore, is necessarily, because its existence 
is thought along with a concept assumed arbitrarily and under 
the condition that I posit its object. 
If I cancel the predicate in an identical judgment and keep the subject, 
then a contradiction arises; hence I say that the former necessarily 
pertains to the latter. But if I cancel the subject together with the predicate, 
then no contradiction arises; for there is no longer anything that 
could be contradicted. To posit a triangle and cancel its three angles is 
contradictory; but to cancel the triangle together with its three angles 
is not a contradiction. It is exactly the same with the concept of an absolutely 
necessary being. If you cancel its existence, then you cancel the A 595 / B 62 3 
thing itself with all its predicates; where then is the contradiction supposed 
to come from? Outside it there is nothing that would contradict 
it, for the thing is not supposed to be externally necessary; and nothing 
internally either, for by cancelling the thing itself, you have at the same 
time cancelled everything internal. God is omnipotent; that is a necessary 
judgment. Omnipotence cannot be cancelled if you posit a divinity, 
i.e., an infinite being, which is identical with that concept. But if you 
say, God is not, then neither omnipotence nor any other of his predicates 
is given; for they are all cancelled together with the subject, and 
in this thought not the least contradiction shows itself. 
Thus you have seen that if I cancel the predicate of a judgment together 
with the subject, an internal contradiction can never arise, whatever 
the predicate might be. Now no escape is left to you except to say: 
there are subjects that cannot be cancelled at all and thus have to remain. 
But that would be the same as saying that there are absolutely 
necessary subjects just 
the presupposition whose correctness I have 
doubted, and the possibility of which you wanted to show me. For I cannot 
form the least concept of a thing that, if all its predicates were cancelled, 
would leave behind a contradiction, and without a contradiction, A596/B624 
I have through mere pure concepts a priori no mark of impossibility. 
Against all these general inferences (which no human being can 
refuse to draw) you challenge me with one case that you set up as a 
proof through the fact that there is one and indeed only this one concept 
where the non-being or the cancelling of its object is contradictory 
a Object 
565 



A5971 B 625 
Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. III 

within itself, and this is the concept of a most real being. It has, you say, 
all reality, and you are justified in assuming such a being as possible (to 
which I have consented up to this point, even though a non-contradictory 
concept falls far short of proving the possibility of its object).* Now 
existence is also comprehended under all reality: thus existence lies in 
the concept of something possible. If this thing is cancelled, then the internal 
possibility of the thing is cancelled, which is contradictory. 

I answer: You have already committed a contradiction when you have 
brought the concept of its existence, under whatever disguised name, 
into the concept of a thing which you would think merely in terms of 
its possibility. If one allows you to do that, then you have won the illusion 
of a victory, but in fact you have said nothing; for you have committed 
a mere tautology. I ask you: is the proposition, This or that 
thing (which I have conceded to you as possible, whatever it may be) 
exists -is this proposition, I say, an analytic or a synthetic proposition? 
If it is the former, then with existence you add nothing to your thought 
of the thing; but then either the thought that is in you must be the 
thing itself, or else you have presupposed an existence as belonging to 
possibility, and then inferred that existence on this pretext from its 
inner possibility, which is nothing but a miserable tautology. The word 
"reality," which sounds different from "existence" in the concept of the 
predicate, does not settle it. For if you call all positing (leaving indeterminate 
what you posit) "reality," then you have already posited the 
thing with all its predicates in the concept of the subject and assumed 

A598/B626 it to be actual, and you only repeat that in the predicate. If you concede, 
on the contrary, as in all fairness you must, that every existential 
proposition is synthetic, then how would you assert that the predicate 
of existence may not be cancelled without contradiction? -since this 
privilege pertains only in the analytic propositions, as resting on its 
very character. 
I would have hoped to annihilate this over-subtle argumentation 

A596/ B 624 * The concept is always possible if it does not contradict itself. That is the logical 
mark of possibility, and thereby the object of the concept is distinguished 
from the nihil negativum! Yet it can nonetheless be an empty concept, if the 
objective reality of the synthesis through which the concept is generated has 
not been established in particular; but as was shown above,98 this always rests 
on principlesb of possible experience and not on the principles of analysis (on 
the principlec of contradiction). This is a warning not to infer immediately 
from the possibility of the concept (logical possibility) to the possibility of the 
thing (real possibility).

Section IV Impossibility of an ontological proof 

without any digressions through a precise determination of the concept 
of existence, if I had not found that the illusion consisting in the confusion 
of a logical predicate with a real one (i.e., the determination of a 
thing) nearly precludes all instruction. Anything one likes can serve as 
a logical predicate, even the subject can be predicated of itself; for 
logic abstracts from every content. But the determination is a predicate, 
which goes beyond the concept of the subject and enlarges it. 
Thus it must not be included in it already. 

Being is obviously not a real predicate, i.e., a concept of something 
that could add to the concept of a thing. It is merely the positing" of a 
thing or of certain determinations in themselves. In the logical use it is 
merely the copula of a judgment. The proposition God is omnipotent 
contains two concepts that have their objects:b God and omnipotence; 
the little word "is" is not a predicate in it, but only that which posits the 
predicate in relation to the subject. Now if! take the subject (God) to-A5991 B 627 
gether with all his predicates (among which omnipotence belongs), and 
say God is, or there is a God, then I add no new predicate toC the concept 
of God, but only posit the subject in itself with all its predicates, 
and indeed posit the object in relation to my concept. Both must contain 
exactly the same, and hence when I think this object as given absolutely 
(through the expression, "it is"), nothing is thereby added to 
the concept, which expresses merely its possibility. Thus the actual contains 
nothing more than the merely possible. A hundred actual dollars 
do not contain the least bit more than a hundred possible ones. For 
since the latter signifies the concept and the former its object and its 
positingf in itself, then, in case the former contained more than the latter, 
my concept would not express the entire object and thus would not 
be the suitable concept of it. But in my financial condition there is more 
with a hundred actual dollars than with the mere concept of them (i.e., 
their possibility). For with actuality the object is not merely included in 
my concept analytically, but adds synthetically to my concept (which is 
a determination of my state); yet the hundred dollars themselves that I 
am thinking of are not in the least increased through this being outside 
my concept. 

Thus when I think a thing, through whichever and however many A6oo/B628 
predicates I like (even in its thoroughgoing determination), not the 
least bit gets added to the thing when I posit in addition that this thing 
is. For otherwise what would exist would not be the same as what I had 
thought in my concept, but more than that, and I could not say that the

very object of my concept exists. Even if I think in a thing every reality 
except one, then the missing reality does not get added when I say the 
thing exists, but it exists encumbered with just the same defect as I have 
thought in it; otherwise something other than what I thought would 
exist. Now if I think of a being as the highest reality (without defect), 
the question still remains whether it exists or not. For although nothing 
at all is missing in my concept of the possible real content of a thing 
in general, something is still missing in the relation to my entire state 
of thinking, namely that the cognition of this objece should also be 
possible a posteriori. And here the cause of the predominant difficulty 
shows itself. If the issue were an object of sense, then I could not confuse 
the existence of the thing with the mere concept of the thing. For 
through its concept, the object would be thought only as in agreement 
with the universal conditions of a possible empirical cognition in general, 
but through its existence it would be thought as contained in the 

A601 / B629 context of the entirety of experience; thus through connection with the 
content of the entire experience the concept of the object is not in the 
least increased, but our thinking receives more through it, namely a 
possible perception. If, on the contrary, we tried to think existence 
through the pure category alone, then it is no wonder that we cannot 
assign any mark distinguishing it from mere possibility. 
Thus whatever and however much our concept of an object may contain, 
we have to go out beyond it in order to provide it with existence. 
With objects of sense this happens through the connection with some 
perception of mine in accordance with empirical laws; but for objects b 
of pure thinking there is no means whatever for cognizing their existence, 
because it would have to be cognized entirely a priori, but our 
consciousness of all existence (whether immediately through perception 
or through inferences connecting something with perception) belongs 
entirely and without exception to the unity of experience, and though 
an existence outside this field cannot be declared absolutely impossible, 
it is a presupposition that we cannot justify through anything. 

The concept of a highest being is a very useful idea in many respects; 
but just because it is merely an idea, it is entirely incapable all by itself 
A602/B630 of extending our cognition in regard to what exists. It is not even able 
to do so much as to instruct us in regard to the possibility of anything 
more. The analytic mark of possibility, which consists in the fact that 
mere positingsC (realities) do not generate a contradiction, of course, 
cannot be denied of this concept; since,d however, the connection of all

real properties in a thing is a synthesis about whose possibility we cannot 
judge a priori because the realities are not given to us specifically 
-and even if this were to happen no judgment at all could take 
place because the mark of possibility of synthetic cognitions always has 
to be sought only in experience, to which, however, the object of an idea 
can never belong -the famous Leibniz was far from having achieved 
what he flattered himself he had done, namely, gaining insight a priori 
into the possibility of such a sublime ideal being.99 

Thus the famous ontological (Cartesian) prooflOo of the existence of 
a highest being from concepts is only so much trouble and labor lost, 
and a human being can no more become richer in insight from mere 
ideas than a merchant could in resources if he wanted to improve his financial 
state by adding a few zeros to his cash balance. 

Chapter Three A603h/B63I 
Section Five 
On the impossibility of a cosmological proof of 
God's existence. 101 
It was entirely unnatural, and a mere novelty of scholastic wit, to want 
to take an idea contrived quite arbitrarily and extract from it the existence 
of the corresponding object itself. In fact one would never have 
tried this path if it had not been preceded by a need of our reason to assume 
for existence in general a basis in something necessary (with 
which one could stop the ascent), and if -since this necessity has to be 
unconditioned and certain a priori -reason were not compelled to seek 
a concept that, if possible, was sufficient to meet this demand by providing 
an existence that is supposed to be cognized fully a priori. It was 
believed that this had been found in the idea of a most real being, and 
this was therefore used only to provide more determinate acquaintance 
with something of which one was already convinced or persuaded on 
other grounds that it must exist, namely, the necessary being. Meanwhile 
this natural course of reason was concealed, and instead of ending 
with this concept one sought to begin with it in order to derive the 
necessity of the existence from it, which, however, this concept was fit 
only to augment.a From this arose the unfortunate ontological proof, A604/hB632 
which brings no satisfaction either to the natural and healthy understanding 
or to scholastically correct examination. 
The cosmological proof, which we will now investigate, retains the 
connection of absolute necessity with the highest reality, but instead of 
inferring as in the previous argument from the highest reality to necessity 
of existence, it rather infers from the previously given uncondia 
•••die er doch nur zu erganzen bestimmt war. 

569 



Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. III 

tioned necessity of some being or other to the unbounded reality of this 
being, thus setting everything on the track of a species of inference that, 
whether reasonable or sophisticaV is at least natural, and has been the 
most persuasive one not only for the common but also for the speculative 
understanding; it is also the one that visibly draws the outlinesb for 
all the proofs of natural theology, outlines which have always been followed 
and will be followed further, however one might try to embellish 
and disguise them with so much foliage and scrollwork. This proof, 
which Leibniz also called the proof a contingentia mundi,c we will now 
place before our eyes and subject to examination.102 

It goes as follows: If something exists, then an absolutely necessary 
being also has to exist. Now I myself, at least, exist; therefore, an absolutely 
necessary being exists. The minor premise contains an experi


A60S/B633 ence, the major premise an inference from an experience in general to 
the existence of something necessary. * Thus the proof really starts from 
experience, so it is not carried out entirely a priori or ontologically; and 
because the object of all possible experience is called "world," it is 
therefore termed the cosmological proof. Since it also abstracts from 
every particular property of objects of experience through which this 
world might differ from any other possible world, it is already distinguished 
by this terminology from the physico-theological proof, which 
uses observations about the particular constitution of this sensible 
world of ours for its grounds of proof. 
Now the proof further infers: The necessary being can be determined 
only in one single way, i.e., in regard to all possible predicates, it 
can be determined by only one of them, so consequently it must be 
thoroughly determined through its concept. Now only one single concept 
of a thing is possible that thoroughly determines the thing a priori, 
namely that of an ens realissimum: d Thus the concept of the most real 

A 606 / B 634 being is the only single one through which a necessary being can be 
thought, i.e., there necessarily exists a highest being. 
In this cosmological argument so many sophistical principles come 
together that speculative reason seems to have summoned up all its di


A60S / B 633 * This inference is too well known for it to be necessary to expound it in detail 
here. It rests on the allegedly transcendental natural law of causality that 
everything contingent must have a cause, which, if it in turn is contingent, 
must likewise have its cause, until the series of causes subordinated one to another 
has to end with an absolutely necessary cause, without which it would 
have no completeness.

alectical art so as to produce the greatest possible transcendental illusion. 
We will put off examining it for a while, so as in the meantime to 
make plain only one ruse through which it sets up an old argument in 
disguised form as a new one, and appeals to the agreement of two witnesses, 
namely a pure rational witness and another with empirical credentials, 
where only the first is there all alone, merely altering his 
clothing and voice so as to be taken for a second. In order to ground 
itself securely, this proof gets a footing in experience, and thereby gives 
itself the reputation that it is distinct from the ontological proof, which 
puts its whole trust solely in pure concepts a priori. But the cosmological 
proof avails itself of this experience only to make a single step, 
namely to the existence of a necessary being in general. What this 
being might have in the way of properties, the empirical ground of 
proof cannot teach; rather, here reason says farewell to it entirely and 
turns its inquiry back to mere concepts: namely, to what kinds of properties 
in general an absolutely necessary being would have to have, i.e., A607/B635 
which among all possible things contains within itself the required 
conditions (requisita) for an absolute necessity. ra3 Now reason believes 
it meets with these requisites solely and uniquely in the concept of a 
most real being, and so it infers: that is the absolutely necessary being. 
But it is clear that here one presupposes that the concept of a being of 
the highest reality completely suffices for the concept of an absolute 
necessity in existence, i.e., that from the former the latter may be inferred 
-a proposition the ontological proof asserted, which one thus 
assumes in the cosmological proof and takes as one's ground, although 
one had wanted to avoid it. For absolute necessity is an existence from 
mere concepts. Now if I say: the concept of the ens realissimuma is a 
concept, and indeed the one single concept, that fits necessary existence 
and is adequate to it, then I must admit that the latter could be 
concluded from it. Thus it is really only the ontological proof from 
mere concepts that contains all the force of proof in the so-called 
cosmological proof; and the supposed experience is quite superfluous 
-perhaps leading us only to the concept of a necessary being, but 
not so as to establish this concept in any determinate thing. For as soon 
as we have this intention, we have to abandon all experience at once 
and seek among pure concepts for the one that might contain the conditions 
for the possibility of an absolutely necessary being. But if there A608/ B 63C 
is insight into the possibility of such a being in such a way, then its existence 
is established too; for then what is meant is: among all possibles 
there is one that carries absolute necessity with it, i.e., this being exists 
with absolute necessity. I04 
All semblances in inferring are most easily discovered if one puts 
a "most real being"; again Kant declines it in the genitive. 
571 



Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. III 

them before one's eyes in a scholastically correct way. Here is such a 
presentation. 

If the proposition is correct: "Every absolutely necessary being is at 
the same time the most real being" (which is the nervus probandill of the 
cosmological proof), then like any affirmative judgment, it must be 
convertible per accidens, thus: "Some most real beings are at the same 
time absolutely necessary beings." But now one ens realissimum does not 
differ the least bit from another, and thus what holds of some beings 
contained under this concept holds also of all. Hence I will also be able 
(in this case) to convert the propositionb absolutely, i.e., "Every most 
real being is a necessary being." Now because this proposition is determined 
merely from its concepts a priori, the mere concept of the most 
real being must also carry with it the absolute necessity of this 
being -which is just what the ontological proof asserts and the cosmological 
proof does not want to recognize, despite the fact that it under


A609/B637 lies its inferences, though in a covert way. 

Thus the second way that speculative reason takes in order to prove 
the existence of the highest being is not only deceptive like the first, but 
it even has this further blamable feature in it, that it commits an ignoratio 
elenchi, c promising to put us on a new footpath, but after a little digression 
bringing us once again back to the old one, which for its sake 
we had left behind. 

A short time agoI05 I said that in this cosmological argument an entire 
nest of dialectical presumptions is hidden, which transcendental 
criticism can easily discover and destroy. I will now only cite them, leaving 
it to the reader to investigate further their deceptive principles and 
remove them. 

There is, for example: I) The transcendental principle of inferring 
from the contingent to a cause, which has significance only in the world 
of sense, but which outside it does not even have a sense. For the merely 
intellectual concept of the contingent cannot produce any synthetic 
proposition, such as that of causality, and the principle of causality has 
no significance at all and no mark of its use except in the world of sense; 
here, however, it is supposed to serve precisely to get beyond the world 

A6IOiB638 of sense. 2) The inference from the impossibility of an infinite series of 
causes given one upon another to a first cause, which the principlesd of 
the use of reason itself cannot justify our inferring within experience, 
still less our extending this principle to somewhere beyond it (into 
which the causal chain cannot be extended at all). 3) The false self

satisfaction reason finds in regard to the completion of this series by the 
fact that one finally does away with every condition -without which, 
however, there can be no concept of any necessity -and then since one 
cannot comprehend anything further, one assumes this to be the completion 
of one's concept. 4) The confusion of the logical possibility of a 
concept of all reality united (without internal contradiction) with its 
transcendental possibility, which requires a principle a of the feasibility 
of such a synthesis, but which once again can apply only to the field of 
possible experiences, etc. 

The artifice of the cosmological proof is aimed merely at evading a 
proof of the existence of a necessary being a priori through mere concepts, 
which would have to be carried out ontologically, for which, 
however, we feel ourselves entirely incapable. In this respect, on the 
ground of an actual existence (an experience in general), we infer, as 
best we can, some absolutely necessary condition of that existence. 
Then we have no necessity of explaining the possibility of this condition. 
For, if it has been proved that it exists, then the question of its A6II/B639 
possibility is quite unnecessary. Now if we want to determine this necessary 
being more closely as to its constitution, then we do not seek 
what would suffice to comprehend from its concept the necessity of its 
existence; for if we could do that, then we would not have had the need 
of any empirical presupposition; no, we seek only the negative condition 
(conditio sine qua non) without which a being would not be absolutely 
necessary. Now that might very well get by in any other 
species of inference from a given consequence to its ground; but here, 
unfortunately, it so happens that the condition that one demands for 
absolute necessity can be encountered only in a single being, which 
therefore must contain everything in its concept that is required for 
absolute necessity, and thus makes possible an inference a priori to that; 
i.e., I have to be able to infer conversely that whatever thing this concept 
(of the highest reality) pertains to, that thing is absolutely necessary; 
and if I cannot so infer (as I must admit, if I want to avoid the 
ontological proof), then I have come to grief on my new path, and find 
myself once again right back where I started. The concept of the highest 
being satisfies all questions a priori that can be posed about the 
inner determinations of a thing, and it is therefore an ideal without 
equal, because the universal concept at the same time distinguishesb it A6I2/B640 
as one individual among all possible things. But it does not deal at all 
satisfactorily with the question about its own existence, though that is 
really all that was at issue; and to those who assume the existence of a 
necessary being, and would only know which among all things had to

Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. III 

be regarded as such a thing, one could not answer: This thing here is 
the necessary being. 

It may well be allowed to assume the existence of a being of the 
highest sufficiency as the cause of all possible effects, in order to facilitate 
reason's search for the unity of its grounds of explanation. Yet to go 
so far as to say, Such a being exists necessarily, is no longer the modest 
expression of an allowable hypothesis, but rather the impudent presumption 
of an apodictic certainty; for if one proposes to cognize 
something as absolutely necessary, then that cognition must also carry 
absolute necessity with it. 

The entire problem of the transcendental ideal comes to this: either 
to find a concept for the absolute necessity or to find the absolute necessity 
for the concept of some thing. If one can do the first, then one 
must be able to do the other too; for reason cognizes as absolutely necessary 
only what is necessary from its concept. But both entirely transcend 
all the utmost efforts to satisfy our understanding on this point, 
but also all attempts to make it content with its incapacity. 

The unconditioned necessity, which we need so indispensably as the 
ultimate sustainer of all things, is for human reason the true abyss. Even 
eternity -however awful the sublimity with which a HallerI06 might 
portray it -does not make such a dizzying impression on the mind; for 
eternity only lacks the duration of things, but it does not sustain that 
duration. One cannot resist the thought of it, but one also cannot bear 
it that a being that we represent to ourselves as the highest among 
all possible beings might, as it were, say to itself: "I am from eternity to 
eternity, outside me is nothing except what is something merely 
through my will; but whence then am I?" Here everything gives way 
beneath us, and the greatest perfection as well as the smallest, hovers 
without support before speculative reason, for which it would cost 
nothing to let the one as much as the other disappear without the least 
obstacle. 

Many forces of nature that express their existence only through certain 
effects remain inscrutable for us, for we cannot trace them far 
enough through observation. The transcendental objecta lying at the 
ground of appearances, and with it the ground why our sensibility has 

A614/ B 642 it rather than another supreme condition -these are and remain inscrutable 
for us, even though the thing itselfb is given, only we have no 
insight into it. An ideal of pure reason, however, cannot be called inscrutable, 
because it has to display no further credentials for its reality 
than the need of reason to complete all synthetic unity by means of it.

as such an object; rather, as a mere idea it must find both its seat and its 
solution in the nature of reason, and so it can be investigated;a for reason 
consists just in the fact that we can give an account of all our concepts, 
opinions and assertions, either on objective grounds or, if they 
are a mere illusion, on subjective ones. 

Discovery and explanation of the dialectical illusion in all 
transcendental proofs of the existence of a necessary being. 

Both the proofs previously cited were attempted transcendentally, i.e., 

independently of empirical principles.b For although the cosmological 

proof is grounded on an experience in general, it is not carried out on 

the basis of any particular constitution of experience, but of pure prin


ciples of reasonC in relation to an existence given through empirical 

consciousness in general; and even this introduction is an occasion for A6rS/B643 

basing itself on entirely pure concepts. Now what in these transcen


dental proofs is the cause of the dialectical but natural illusion that con


nects the concepts of necessity and highest reality and that realizes and 

hypostatizes that which can be only an idea? What causes it to be un


avoidable to assume something among existing things to be in itself 

necessary, and yet at the same time to shrink back from the existence of 

such a being as an abyss? And how is one to bring reason to an under


standing of itself over this matter, so that from a vacillating state of dif


ferent approval it may achieve one of calm insight? 
There is something exceedingly remarkable in the fact that when one 
presupposes something existing, one can find no way around the con


clusion that something also exists necessarily. It is on this entirely nat


ural (though not for this reason secure) inference that the cosmological 

argument rested. On the contrary, if I assume the concept of anything 

I like, then I find that its existence can never be represented by me as 


absolutely necessary, and that whatever may exist, nothing hinders me 

from thinking its non-being; hence although for the existing in general 

I must assume something necessary, I cannot think any single thing it


self as necessary in itself. That means: in going back to the conditions A6r6/B644 

of existing I can never complete the existing without assuming a necessary 
being,d but I can never begin with this being. 
If I must think something necessary for existing things in general but 
am not warranted in thinking any thing in itself as necessary, then it fol

tain to or concern the things themselves, because otherwise a contradiction 
would occur; hence neither of these two principles is objective, but 
they can in any case be only subjective principleso of reason, namely, on 
the one side, for everything given as existing to seek something that is 
necessary, i.e., never to stop anywhere except with an a priori complete 
explanation, but on the other side also never to hope for this completion, 
i.e., never to assume anything empirical as unconditioned, thereby exempting 
oneself from its further derivation. In such a significance both 
principles can very well coexist with one another, as merely heuristic and 
regulative, taking care of nothing but the formal interest of reason. For 
the one says that you should philosophize about nature as if there were 
a necessarily first ground for everything belonging to existence, solely in 
order to bring systematic unity into your cognition by inquiring after 
such an idea, namely an imagined first ground; but the other warns you 


A6I7/B645 not to assume any single determination dealing with the existence of 
things as such a first ground, i.e., as absolutely necessary, but always to 
hold the way open to further derivation and hence always to treat it as 
still conditioned. But if everything perceived in things by usb has to be 
considered as necessarily conditioned, then no thing (which may be 
given empirically) can be regarded as absolutely necessary. 
From this, however, it follows that you would have to assume the absolutely 
necessary being as outside the world, because it is supposed 
to serve only as a principle' of the greatest possible unity of appearances, 
as their supreme ground; and you can never reach it within the 
world, because the second rule bids you at every time to regard all empirical 
causes of unity as derivative. 
The philosophers of antiquity regardd every form of nature as contingent, 
but the matter, in accordance with the judgment of common 
reason, as original and necessary. But if they had considered the matter 
not as a substratum respective to appearances but in itself as to its existence, 
then the idea of absolute necessity would have disappeared at 
once. For there is nothing that binds reason absolutely to this existence; 
on the contrary, it can, at any time and without conflict, give such a 
thing up in thoughts; but it is in thoughts alone that absolute necessity 

A6IS/B646 lies. Hence a certain regulative principlee must be the ground of this 
persuasion. In fact extension and impenetrability (which together constitute 
the concept of matter) is also the highest empirical principle! of

the unity of appearances, and has, insofar as it is empirically unconditioned, 
in itself the properties of a regulative principle.a Nevertheless, 
since each determination of matter that constitutes what is real in it, 
hence impenetrability too, is an effect (action) that must have its cause, 
and hence is always derivative, matter is not suited to the idea of a necessary 
being as the principleb of all derivative unity, because each of its 
real properties as derivative is only conditionally necessary and hence 
can in itself be cancelled; but then the entire existence of matter would 
be cancelled; but if this did not happen, we would have reached the 
highest ground of unity empirically, which is forbidden by the second 
regulative principle;c thus it follows that matter, and in general everything 
belonging to the world, is not suited to the idea of a necessary 
original being as a mere principled of the greatest empirical unity, but 
this must be posited outside the world, since then we can always be confident 
of deriving the appearances of the world and their existence from 
others, as though there were no necessary being, and nevertheless we 
can strive ceaselessly toward completeness in this derivation, as though 
such a being were presupposed as a highest ground. A619/B647 


The ideal of the highest being is, according to these considerations, 
nothing other than a regulative principle' of reason, to regard all 
combination in the world as if it arose from an all-sufficient necessary 
cause, so as to ground on that cause the rule of a unity that is systematic 
and necessary according to universal laws; but it is not an assertion 
of an existence that is necessary in itself. But at the same time it is unavoidable, 
by means of a transcendental subreption, to represent this 
formal principle! to oneself as constitutive, and to think of this unity 
hypostatically. For, just as with space, since it originally makes possible 
all forms which are merely limitations of it, even though it is only a 
principleg of sensibility, it is necessarily held to be a Something subsisting 
in itself with absolute necessity and an a priori object given in itself, 
so it also comes about entirely naturally that since the systematic unity 
of nature cannot be set up as a principleh of the empirical use of reason 
except on the basis of the idea of a most real being as the supreme cause, 
this idea is thereby represented as an actual object, and this object again, 
because it is the supreme condition, is represented as necessary, so that

A620/B648 a regulative principlea is transformed into a constitutive one; this substitution 
reveals itself by the fact that if I now consider this supreme 
being, which was absolutely (unconditionally) necessary respective to 
the world, as a thing for itself, no concept is susceptible of this necessity; 
and thus it must have been encountered in my reason only as a formal 
condition of thought, and not as a material and hypostatic condition 
of existence. 

ChapterThree 
Section Six 
On the impossibility of a physico-theological proofI07 

If, then, neither the concept of things in general nor the experience of 

any existence in general can achieve what is required, then one means 

is still left: to see whether a determinate experience, that of the things 

in the present world, their constitution and order, yields a ground of 

proof that could help us to acquire a certain conviction of the existence 

of a highest being. Such a proof we would call the physico-theologi


cal proof.108 Ifthis too should be impossible, then no satisfactory proof 

from speculative reason for the existence of a being that corresponds to 

our transcendental ideas is possible at all. 

A62I/B649 From all the above remarks one will soon see that to this inquiry a 
quite easy, concise, and conclusive reply can be expected. For how can 
any experience be given that is supposed to be adequate to an idea? For 
what is special about an idea is just that no experience can ever be congruent 
to it. The transcendental idea of a necessary all-sufficient original 
being is so overwhelmingly great, so sublimely high above everything 
empirical, which is at all times conditioned, that partly one can 
never even procure enough material in experience to fill such a concept, 
and partly if one searches for the unconditioned among conditioned 
things, then one will seek forever and always in vain, since no law of any 
empirical synthesis will ever give an example of such a thing, or even 
the least guidance in looking for it. 
If the highest being were to stand in the chain of these conditions, 
then it would be a member of their series, and like the lower members, 
of which this is presupposed, a further investigation for a still higher 
ground would be required for it. If, on the contrary, one would separate 
it from this chain, and, as a merely intelligible being, not include it 
within the series of natural causes, then what bridge can reason build so 
as to reach it? For all laws of transition from effects to causes, indeed,

nothing other than possible experience, and hence merely to objects of 
the world of sense, and they can have a significance only in regard to A622/B6S0 
them. 

The present world discloses to us such an immeasurable showplace of 
manifoldness, order, purposiveness, and beauty, whether one pursues 
these in the infinity of space or in the unlimited division of it, 109 that in 
accordance with even the knowledgea about it that our weak understanding 
can acquire, all speech concerning so many and such unfathomable 
wonders must lose its power to express, all numbers their power 
to measure, and even our thoughts lack boundaries, so that our judgment 
upon the whole must resolve itself into a speechless, but nonetheless 
eloquent, astonishment. IIO Everywhere we see a chain of effects and 
causes, of ends and means, regularity in coming to be and perishing, 
and because nothing has entered by itselfb into the state in which it 
finds itself, this state always refers further to another thing as its cause, 
which makes necessary just the same further inquiry, so that in such a 
way the entire wholec would have to sink into the abyss of nothingness 
if one did not assume something subsisting for itself originally and independently 
outside this infinite contingency, which supports it and at 
the same time, as the cause of its existence, secures its continuation. 
This highest cause (in regard to all things of the world) -how great 
should one think it is? We are not acquainted with the world in its 
whole content, still less do we know how to estimate its magnitude by A623/B65I 
comparison with everything possible. But since in respect to causality 
we need an ultimate and supreme being, what hinders us from at the 
same time positing in it a degree of perfection exceeding everything 
else that is possible? This we can easily effect, though to be sure only 
through the fragile outline of an abstract concept, if we represent all 
possible perfection united in it as a single substance -which concept is 
favorable to our reason in its parsimony of principles,d not subject to 
any contradictions, and even salutary for the extension of the use of our 
reason within experience, through the guidance such an idea gives to 
order and purposiveness, but is nowhere contrary to experience in any 
decisive way. 

This proof always deserves to be named with respect. It is the oldest, 
clearest and the most appropriate to common human reason. It enlivens 
the study of nature, just as it gets its existence from this study and 
through it receives ever renewed force. It brings in ends and aims where 
they would not have been discovered by our observation itself, and ex-

tends our information about nature through the guiding thread of a 
particular unity whose principlea is outside nature. But this acquain


A624/B652 tance also reacts upon its cause, namely the idea that occasioned it, and 
increases the belief in a highest author to the point where it becomes an 
irresistible conviction. 
Thus it would be not only discomfiting but also quite pointless to try 
to remove anything from the reputation of this proof. Reason, ceaselessly 
elevated by the powerful though only empirical proofs that are always 
growing in its hands, cannot be so suppressed through any doubt 
drawn from subtle and abstract speculation that it is not torn at once 
out of every brooding indecision, just as from a dream, by throwing a 
glance on the wonders of nature and the majesty of the world's architecture,
b by which it elevates itself from magnitude to magnitude up to 
the highest of all, rising from the conditioned to the condition, up to 
the supreme and unconditioned author. 

But although we have nothing to object against the rationality and 
utility of this procedure, but rather recommend and encourage it, we 
cannot on that account approve of the claims that this kind of proof may 
make to apodictic certainty and to having no need for approval based 
on any special favor or need of outside support; it can in no way harm 
the good cause to tone down the dogmatic language of a scornful 
sophist'" to the tone of moderation and modesty of a belief that is sufficient 
to comfort us, although not to command unconditional submission. 
Accordingly, I assert that the physico-theological proof can never 
establish the existence of a highest being alone, but must always leave it 
up to the ontological proof (to which it serves only as an introduction) 
in order to make good this lack; thus the latter still contains the only 
possible argument!II (insofar as there is a merely speculative proof at 
all), which no human reason can bypass. 

The chief moments of the physico-theological proof we are thinking 
of are the following: I) Everywhere in the world there are clear signs of 
an order according to determinate aim, carried out with great wisdom, 
and in a whole of indescribable manifoldness in content as well as of unbounded 
magnitude in scope. 2) This purposive order is quite foreign 
to the things of the world, and pertains to them only contingently, i.e., 
the natures of different things could not by themselvese agree in so 
many united means to determinate final aims, were they not quite properly 
chosen for and predisposed to it through a principle! of rational

order grounded on ideas. 3) Thus there exists a sublime and wise cause 
(or several), which must be the cause of the world not merely as an allpowerful 
nature working blindly through fecundity, but as an intelligence, 
through freedom. 4) The unity of this cause may be inferred 
from the unity of the reciprocal relation of the parts of the world as 
members of an artful structure, inferred with certainty wherever our A6261 B 654 
observation reaches, but beyond that with probability in accordance 
with all principles of analogy. 

Without quibbling with natural reason about the inference it draws 
from the analogy between natural products and those of human art, 
when it does violence to nature and constrains it not to proceed in accordance 
with its own ends but to bend to ours (the similarity of nature's 
ends to houses, ships, and clocks), just such a causality, namely 
understanding and will, is made a ground, when it derives the inner 
possibility of freely working nature (which makes all art, and perhaps 
even reason itself, possible) from another though superhuman art, 
which sort of inference perhaps might not stand up to the sharpest transcendental 
critique -one must nevertheless admit that once we are supposed 
to name a cause, we could not proceed more securely than by 
analogy with such purposive productions,a which are the only ones 
where we are fully acquainted with the causes and the way they act. 
Reason would not be able to justifyb to itself an attempt to pass over 
from a causality with which it is acquainted to obscure and unprovable 
grounds of explanation, with which it is not acquainted. 

According to this inference, the purposiveness and well-adaptedness 
of so many natural arrangements would have to prove merely the contingency 
of the form, but not of the matter, i.e., of substance, in the A627I B 655 
world; for the latter would further require that it be able to be proved 
that the things of the world would in themselves be unsuited for such 
an order and harmony according to universal laws if they were not in 
their substance the product of a highest wisdom; but entirely different 
grounds of proof from those provided by the analogy with human art 
would be required for this. Thus the proof could at most establish a 
highest architect of the world, who would always be limited by the 
suitability of the material on which he works, but not a creator of the 
world, to whose idea everything is subject, which is far from sufficient 
for the great aim that one has in view, namely that of proving an a11sufficient 
original being. If we wanted to prove the contingency of matter 
itself, then we would have to take refuge in a transcendental argument, 
which, however, is exactly what was supposed to be avoided here. 

The inference thus goes from the thoroughgoing order and purpo


a Erzeugungen 
b verantworten 
581 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. III 


siveness that is to be observed in the world, as a thoroughly contingent 
arrangement, to the existence of a cause proportioned to it. The concept 
of this cause, however, has to give us something quite determinate 
to cognize about it, and thus it cannot be anything other than that of a 
being that possesses all power, wisdom, etc., in a word, all perfection, as 

A628/B656 an all-sufficient being. For the predicates very great, or "astonishing" 
or "immeasurable power" and "excellence" do not give any determinate 
concept at all, and really say nothing about what the thing in itself is, 
but are rather only relative representations, through which the observer 
(of the world) compares the magnitude of the object with himself and 
his power to grasp it, and they turn out to be terms of equally high 
praise whether one increases the magnitude of the object or makes the 
observing subject smaller in relation to it. Where it is a question of 
the magnitude (perfection) of a thing in general, there is no determinate 
concept except that which comprehends the whole of possible perfection, 
and only the All (ornnitudo) of reality is thoroughly determinate in 
its concept. 
Now I will not hope that anyone presumes to have insight into the 
relation of the magnitude of the world as he has observed it (in its scope 
as well as its content) to omnipotence, or the world-order to highest 
wisdom, or the unity of the world to the absolute unity of its author, etc. 
Thus physico-theology cannot give any determinate concept of the 
supreme cause of the world, and hence it cannot be sufficient for a principlea 
of theology, which is supposed to constitute in turn the foundation 
of religion. 

The step to absolute totality is utterly impossible on the empirical 
path. But it is nevertheless made in the physico-theological proof. SO 
A629/B 657 what means are employed to get across such a wide gulf? 

Mter one has gotten as far as admiring the magnitude of the wisdom, 
power, etc. of the world's author, and cannot get any farther, then one 
suddenly leaves this argument carried out on empirical grounds of 
proof and goes back to the contingency that was inferred right at the 
beginning from the world's order and purposiveness. Now one proceeds 
from this contingency alone, solely through transcendental concepts, 
to the existence of something absolutely necessary, and then from 
the concept of the absolute necessity of the first cause to its thoroughly 
determinate or determining concept, namely that of an all-encompassing 
reality. Thus the physico-theological proof, stymied in its undertaking, 
suddenly jumps over to the cosmological proof, and since this is 
only a concealed ontological proof, it really carries through its aim 
merely through pure reason, even though at the beginning this denied 


a Princip 

582 



Section VII. Critique of all speculative theology 

all kinship with it and had proposed to base everything on evident 
proofs from experience. 

Thus the physico-theologians have no cause at all to be so coy when 
it comes to the transcendental kind of proof and to look down on it with 
the self-conceit of clearsighted students of nature looking down on the 
webs spun by gloomy quibblers. a For if they would only examine themselves, 
they would find that after they have made a certain amount of 
progress on the territory of nature and experience and seen themselves A630/B 658 
just as far removed as ever from the object with which their reason 
seems to confront them/ they suddenly leave this territory and pass 
over into the realm of mere possibilities, where on the wings of ideas 
they hope to approach that which has eluded all their empirical inquiries. 
After they finally suppose they have got firm footing through 
such a mighty leap, then they extend the now determinate concept 
(without knowing how they have come to be in possession of it) over 
the entire field of creation, and they elucidate the ideal, which was 
merely the product of pure reason -though shabbily enough and in a 
way far beneath the dignity of its object -through experience, though 
without being willing to concede that they have achieved their acquaintance 
with it, or their presupposition of it, while they were on a 
different footpath from that of experience. 

Accordingly, the physico-theological proof of the existence of a single 
original being as the highest being is grounded on the cosmological, 
and the latter on the ontological; and since besides these three paths 
no more are open to speculative reason, the ontological proof from 
pure concepts of reason is the only possible one -if even one proof of 
a proposition elevated so sublimely above all empirical use of the understanding 
is possible at all.

Critique of all theology from speculative principlesc 

of reason. II2 

If by "theology" I understand the cognition of the original being, then 
it is either from pure reason (theologia rationalis) or from revelation (revelata). 
Now the first of these thinks its object either merely through 
pure reason, by means of sheer transcendental concepts (as an ens originarium, 
realissimum, ens entium)d and is called transcendental theology,

or else through a concept which it borrows from nature (the nature of 
our soul) as the highest intelligence, and would have to be called natural 
theology. Someone who admits only a transcendental theology 
would be called a deist; but if he also acceptsa a natural theology, he 
would be called a theist. The former concedes that we can in any case 
cognize the existence of an original being through mere reason, but our 
concept of it is merely transcendentalh-namely, only that of a being 
having all reality, but it cannot be determined more closely. The second 
asserts that reason is in a position to determine the object more closely 
by analogy with nature -namely as a being containing the original 
ground of all other things within itself through understanding and freedom. 
The deist represents this being merely as a cause of the world 


A63z1B660 (whether through the necessity of its nature or through freedom remains 
undecided), the theist as an author of the world. 
Transcendental theology either thinks that the existence of an original 
being is to be derived from an experience in general (without more 
closely determining anything about the world to which this experience 
belongs), and is called cosmotheology; or it believes that it can 
cognize that existence through mere concepts, without the aid of even 
the least experience, and is called ontotheology. 
Natural theology infers the properties and the existence of an author 
of the world from the constitution, the order and unity, that are 
found in this world, in which two kinds of causality and its rules have to 
be assumed, namely nature and freedom. Hence it ascends from this 
world to the highest intelligence, either as the principleb of all natural 
or of all moral order and perfection. In the first case it is called 
physico-theology, in the latter moral theology.* 

Since one is accustomed to understanding by the concept of God not 
some blindly working eternal nature as the root of things, but rather a 
A 6 33/ B 66 I highest being which is supposed to be the author of things through understanding 
and freedom -and since this concept alone interests 
us -one could, strictly speaking, refuse all belief in God to the deist, 
and leave him solely with the assertion of an original being or a highest 
cause. However, since no one should be charged with wanting to deny 
something just because he does not have the confidence to assert it, it 

A632 / B 660 * Not theological morals; for that contains moral laws that presuppose the existence 
of a highest governor of the world, whereas moral theology, on the 
contrary, is a conviction of the existence of a highest being which grounds itself 
on moraltlaws.c

is gentler and fairer to say that the deist believes in a God, but the theist 
in a living God (summa intelligentia). a Now we want to seek out the 
possible sources of all these attempts of reason. 

Here I content myself with defining theoretical cognition as that 
through which I cognize what exists, and practical cognition as that 
through which I represent what ought to exist. According to this, the 
theoretical use of reason is that through which I cognize a priori (as necessary) 
that something is; but the practical use is that through which it 
is cognized a priori what ought to happen. Now if it is indubitably certain, 
but only conditionally, that something either is or that it should 
happen, then either a certain determinate condition can be absolutely 
necessary for it, or it can be presupposed as only optionalb and contingent. 
In the first case the condition is postulated (per thesin),c in the second 
it is supposed (per hypothesin).d Since there are practical laws that 
are absolutely necessary (the moral laws), then if these necessarily presuppose 
any existence as the condition of the possibility of their bind-A634/B 662 
ing force, this existence has to be postulated, because the conditioned 
from which the inference to this determinate condition proceeds is itself 
cognized a priori as absolutely necessary. In the future we will show 
about the moral laws that they not only presuppose the existence of a 
highest being, but also, since in a different respect they are absolutely 
necessary, they postulate this existence rightfully but, of course, only 
practically; for now we will set aside this kind of inference. I I 3 

Since if it is merely a matter of what exists (not of what ought to be), 
the conditioned that is given to us in experience is also always thought of 
as contingent, then the condition that belongs to it cannot be cognized 
from this as absolutely necessary, but serves only as a relatively necessary 
-Or rather as a required but in itself and a priori arbitrary -presupposition 
for the rational cognition of the conditioned. If, therefore, the 
absolute necessity of a thing is to be cognized in theoretical cognition, 
then this could happen only from concepts a priori, but never as a cause 
in relation to an existence that is given through experience. 

A theoretical cognition is speculative if it pertains to an object or 
concepts of an object to which one cannot attain in any experience. It is 
opposed to the cognition of nature, which pertains to no objects, or A63S/B663 
their predicates, except those that can be given in a possible experience. 

The principle of inferring from what happens (the empirically contingent) 
as effect to a cause, is a principle< of the cognition of nature, 


a "highest intelligence"; Kant declines the Latin phrase in the accusative.

but not of speculative cognition. For if one abstracts from it as a principle 
that contains the condition of possible experience in general, and, 
leaving out everything empirical, wants to assert it of the contingent in 
general, then not the least justification is left over for any synthetic 
proposition from which it can be discerned how I can go from what exists 
to something entirely different (called its cause); indeed, in such a 
speculative use the concept of a cause, like that of the contingent, loses 
all the significance that is made comprehensible by its objective reality 

in concreto. 

Now if one infers from the existence of things in the world to their 
cause, this does not belong to the natural but to the speculative use of 
reason; for the former does not relate the things themselves (substances) 
to any cause, but relates to a cause only what happens, thus 
their states, as empirically contingent; that the substance itself (the 
matter) is contingent as to its existence would have to be a merely spec


A636/B664 ulative cognition of reason. But if it were only a matter of the form of 
the world, the way it is combined and the changes of combination, yet 
I wanted to infer from this to a cause that is entirely distinct from the 
world, then this once again would be a judgment of merely speculative 
reason, because the object here is not any objecta of a possible experience. 
But then the principle of causality, which holds only within llie 
field of possible experience and outside it is without any use or indeed 
without any meaning,b would be completely diverted from its vocation. 
Now I assert that all attempts of a merely speculative use of reason in 
regard to theology are entirely fruitless and by their internal constitution 
null and nugatory, but that the principlesc of reason's natural use 
do not lead at all to any theology; and consequently, if one did not 
ground it on moral laws or use them as guides, there could be no theology 
of reason at all. For all synthetic principles of understanding are 
of immanent use; but for the cognition of a highest being a transcendent 
use of them would be required, for which our understanding is not 
equipped at all. If the empirically valid law of causality is to lead to an 
original being, then this would have to belong to the causal chain in objects 
of experience; but then it, like all appearances, would have to be 

A637 1B66S conditioned. But even if one were allowed to leap over the boundary of 
experience by means of the dynamical law of the relation of effects to 
their causes, what concept can this procedure obtain for us? Far from 
any concept of a highest being, because for us experience never offers 
us the greatest of all possible effects (such as would bear witness to this 
as its cause). If, merely so that nothing empty is left in our reason, we 

a Object 
b Bedeutung 
, Principien 


586 



Section VII. Critique of all speculative theology 

are allowed to make good this lack of complete determination by means 
of a mere idea of the highest perfection and original necessity, then we 
could be permitted this only by special favor, but it cannot be demanded 
by the right of an irresistible proof. Thus the physico-theological proof 
could perhaps lend support to other proofs (if there were any), by connecting 
speculation with intuition; but by itselfa it is more a preparation 
of the understanding for theological cognition, providing it with a 
straight and natural direction toward such cognition; it cannot complete 
the business alone.' '4 

Thus from this one can very well see that transcendental questions 
admit only of transcendental answers, i.e., answers from pureb a priori 
concepts, without the least empirical admixture. But here the question 
is obviously synthetic and demands an extension of our cognition beyond 
all the boundaries of experience, namely to the existence of a 
being that is supposed to correspond to our mere idea, to which no ex-A638/B666 
perience can ever be equal. Now, according to the proofs we have given 
above, all synthetic cognition a priori is possible only by the fact that it 
expresses the formal conditions of a possible experience, and all principles 
are therefore only of immanent validity, i.e., they are related solely 
to objects of empirical cognition, or appearances. Thus through transcendental 
procedures aiming at a theology of mere speculative reason 
nothing is accomplished. 

But if one would rather call all the above proofs of the Analytic into 
doubt than be robbed of the persuasion that these grounds of proof that 
have been used for so long are of great weight, even then one cannot 
refuse to satisfy me when I demand that one should at least explain how, 
and by means of what illumination, one is justified in confidently soaring 
above all possible experience through the power of mere ideas. New 
proofs, or improved reworkings of old ones, I would beg to be spared. 
For there is not much to choose here, since all merely speculative 
proofs finally amount to one single proof, namely the ontological, and 
I need not fear being overburdened by the fertility of the dogmatic 
champion of reason freed from sense; though without thinking myself 
very combative I will not refuse the challenge of discovering the fallacy A639/B667 
in every such attempt of this kind, and so frustrate its pretensions; yet 
in this way the hope for better luck on the part of those who have become 
accustomed to dogmatic persuasion will never be fully done away 
with, and so I confine myself to one single fair demand: that one should 
provide a general justification, based on the nature of human understanding, 
together with all remaining sources of cognition, for making 
a start at extending one's cognition entirely a priori and stretching it 

a for sich selbst 
b tauter 


587 


Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. III 

even to where no possible experience and hence no means suffices to secure 
objective reality for any of the concepts we have thought out. 
However the understanding may have obtained these concepts, the existence 
of their object cannot be found in them analytically, just because 
the cognition of the existence of the object a consists precisely in positing 
this existence in itself outside the thought. But it is entirely impossible 
to go from a concept by itself out beyond it and, without 
following its empirical connection (which, however, will at every time 
provide only appearances), to attain to the discovery of new objects and 
transcendentb beings. 

But even though reason in its merely speculative use is far from adequate 
for such a great aim as this -namely, attaining to the existence of 
a supreme being -it still has in them a very great utility, that of COf


A640/B 668 recting the cognition of this being by making it agree with itself and 
with every intelligible aim, and by purifYing it of everything that might 
be incompatible with the concept of an original being, and of all admixture 
of empirical limitations. 
Accordingly, despite all of its inadequacies, transcendental theology 
retains an important negative use, and is a constant censor of our reason 
when it has to do merely with pure ideas, which for this very reason 
admit of no standard but the transcendental one. For if in some other, 
perhaps practical relation, the presupposition of a highest and all-sufficient 
being, as supreme intelligence, were to assert its validity without 
any objection, then it would be of the greatest importance to determine 
this concept precisely on its transcendental side, as the concept of a necessary 
and most real being, to get rid of what is incompatible with the 
highest reality, what belongs to mere appearance (anthropomorphism, 
broadly understood), and at the same time to get out of the way all opposed 
assertions, whether they be atheistic, deistic or anthropomorphic; 
all this is very easy to do in such a critical treatment, since the same 
grounds for considering human reason incapable of asserting the exis


A641 / B669 tence of such a being, when laid before our eyes, also suffice to prove the 
unsuitabilityc of all counter-assertions. For where, by pure speculation of 
reason, will anyone acquire the insight that there is no highest being as 
the original ground of everything? Or that none of the properties apply 
to it that we represent, in accordance with their consequences, as analogical 
with the dynamic realities of a thinking being? Or that, in the latter 
case, they have to be subject to all the limitations inevitably imposed 
by sensibility on the intelligences with which experience acquaints us?d

Section VII. Critique of all speculative theology 

Thus the highest being remains for the merely speculative use of reason 
a mere but nevertheless faultless ideal, a concept which concludes 
and crowns the whole of human cognition, whose objective reality cannot 
of course be proved on this path, but also cannot be refuted; and if 
there should be a moral theology that can make good this lack, then 
transcendental theology, up to now only problematic, will prove to be 
indispensable through determining its concept and by ceaselessly censoring 
a reason that is deceived often enough by sensibility and does not 
always agree with its own ideas. Necessity, infinity, unity, existence outside 
the world (not as soul of the world), eternity without all conditions 
of time, omnipresence without all conditions of space, omnipotence, 
etc.: these are purely transcendental predicates, and hence a purified A642/B670 
concept of them, which every theology needs so very badly, can be 
drawn only from transcendental theology.a 

a In his copy of the first edition, Kant adds: "Whether, if there is no demonstration of the 
existence of God, there is not at least a great probability. This is not at all worthy of the 
object [Objects] also not possible on this path. Probability in the absolutely necessary is 
contradictory.

Appendix 
to the Transcendental Dialectic 

On the regulative use of the ideas 

IIS

of pure reason. 

The outcome of all dialectical attempts of pure reason not only confirms 
what we have already proved in the Transcendental Analytic, 
namely that all the inferences that would carry us out beyond the field 
of possible experience are deceptive and groundless, but it also simultaneously 
teaches us this particular lesson: that human reason has a natural 
propensity to overstep all these boundaries, and that transcendental 
ideas are just as natural to it as the categories are to the understanding, 
although with this difference, that just as the categories lead to truth, 
i.e., to the agreement of our concepts with their objects,a the ideas effect 
a mere, but irresistible, illusion, deception by which one can hardly 
resist even through the most acute criticism. 

Everything grounded in the nature of our powers must be purposive 
and consistent with their correct use, if only we can guard against a cer


A643/B671 tain misunderstanding and find out their proper direction. Thus the 
transcendental ideas too will presumably have a good and consequently 
immanent use, even though, if their significance is misunderstood and 
they are taken for concepts of real things, they can be transcendent in 
their application and for that very reason deceptive. For in regard to 
the whole of possible experience, it is not the idea itself but only its use 
that can be either extravagant (transcendent) or indigenous (immanent), 
according to whether one directs them straightway to a supposed 
object corresponding to them, or only to the use of the understanding 
in general regarding the objects with which it has to do; and all errors 
of subreption are always to be ascribed to a defect in judgment, never 
to understanding or to reason. 
Reason never relates directly to an object, but solely to the understanding 
and by means of it to reason's own empirical use, hence it does 
not create any concepts (of objects)b but only orders them and gives 


a Objecte

them that unity which they can have in their greatest possible extension, 
i.e., in relation to the totality of series; the understanding does not look 
to this totality at all, but only to the connection through which series 
of conditions always come about according to concepts. Thus reason 
really has as object only the understanding and its purposive applicaA644/
hB672 
tion, and just as the understanding unites the manifold into an object" 
through concepts, so reason on its side unites the manifold of concepts 
through ideas by positing a certain collective unity as the goal of the understanding's 
actions, which are otherwise concerned only with distributive 
unity. 
Accordingly, I assert: the transcendental ideas are never of constitutive 
use, so that the concepts of certain objects would thereby be given, 
and in case one so understands them, they are merely sophistical (dialectical) 
concepts. On the contrary, however, they have an excellent and 
indispensably necessary regulative use, namely that of directing the understanding 
to a certain goal respecting which the lines of direction of 
all its rules converge at one point, which, although it is only an idea 
(focus imaginarius) i.
e., a point from which the concepts of the understanding 
do not really proceed, since it lies entirely outside the bounds 
of possible experience -nonetheless still serves to obtain for these concepts 
the greatest unity alongside the greatest extension. Now of course 
it is from this that there arises the deception, as if these lines of direction 
were shot outb from an object lying outside the field of possible 
empirical cognition (just as objectsC are seen behind the surface of a 
mirror); yet this illusion (which can be prevented from deceiving) is 
nevertheless indispensably necessary if besides the objects before our A64S/B673 
eyes we want to see those that lie far in the background, i.e., when, in 
our case, the understanding wants to go beyond every given experience 
(beyond this part of the whole of possible experience), and hence wants 
to take the measure of its greatest possible and uttermost extension. 
If we survey the cognitions of our understanding in their entire 
range, then we find that what reason quite uniquely prescribes and 
seeks to bring about concerning it is the systematic in cognition, i.e., 
its interconnection based on one principle.d This unity of reason always 
presupposes an idea, namely that of the form of a whole of cognition, 
which precedes the determinate cognition of the parts and contains the 
conditions for determining a priori the place of each part and its relaa

tion to the others. Accordingly, this idea postulates complete unity of 
the understanding's cognition, through which this cognition comes to 
be not merely a contingent aggregate but a system interconnected in 
accordance with necessary laws. One cannot properly say that this idea 
is the concept of an object, a but only that of the thoroughgoing unity 
of these concepts, insofar as the idea serves the understanding as a rule. 
Such concepts of reason are not created by nature, rather we question 
nature according to these ideas, and we take our cognition to be defec


A646/B674 tive as long as it is not adequate to them. Admittedly, it is hard to find 
pure earth, pure water, pure air, etc. Nevertheless, concepts of them 
are required (though as far as their complete purity is concerned, have 
their origin only in reason) in order appropriately to determine the 
share that each of these natural causes has in appearance; thus one reducesb 
all materials to earths (mere weight, as it were), to salts and combustibles 
(as force), and finally to water and air as vehicles (machines, as 
it were, by means of which the aforementioned operate), in order to explain 
the chemical effects of materials in accordance with the idea of a 
mechanism. For even though it is not actually expressed this way, it is 
still very easy to discover the influence of reason on the classifications 
of students of nature. 
If reason is the faculty of deriving the particular from the universal, 
then: Either the universal is in itself certain and given, and only judgment 
is required for subsuming, and the particular is necessarily determined 
through it This I call the "apodictic" use of reason. Or the universal is 
assumed only problematically, and it is a mere idea, the particular 
being certain while the universality of the rule for this consequent is 
still a problem; then several particular cases, which are all certain, are 
tested by the rule, to see if they flow from it, and in the case in which it 

A647/B675 seems that all the particular cases cited follow from it, then the universality 
of the rule is inferred, including all subsequent cases, even those 
that are not given in themselves. This I will call the "hypothetical" use 
of reason. 
The hypothetical use of reason, on the basis of ideas as problematic 
concepts, is not properly constitutive, that is, not such that if one 
judges in all strictness the truth of the universal rule assumed as a hypothesis 
thereby follows; for how is one to know all possible consequences, 
which would prove the universality of the assumed principle if 
they followed from it? Rather, this use of reason is only regulative, 
bringing unity into particular cognitions as far as possible and thereby 
approximating the rule to universality. 
The hypothetical use of reason is therefore directed at the system


a Object 
b bringt ...auf 

592 



Section VII. Critique of all speculative theology 
atic unity of the understanding's cognitions, which, however, is the 
touchstone of truth for its rules. Conversely, systematic unity (as 
mere idea) is only a projected unity, which one must regard not as 
given in itself, but only as a problem;a this unity, however, helps to find 
a principleb for the manifold and particular uses of the understanding, 
thereby guiding it even in those cases that are not given and making it 
coherently connected.c 
From this, however, one sees only that systematic unity or the unity A648/B676 
of reason of the manifold of the understanding's cognition is a logical 
principle,d in order, where the understanding alone does not attain to 
rules, to help it through ideas, simultaneously creating unanimity 
among its various rules under one principle< (the systematic), and 
thereby interconnection, as far as this can be done. But whether the 
constitution of objects or the nature of the understanding that cognizes 
them as such are in themselves determined to systematic unity, and 
whether one could in a certain measure postulate this a priori without 
taking into account such an interest of reason, and therefore say that all 
possible cognitions of the understanding (including empirical ones) 
have the unity of reason, and stand under common principles! from 
which they could be derived despite their variety: that would be a transcendental 
principle of reason, which would make systematic unity not 
merely something subjectively and logically necessary, as method, but 
objectively necessary. 
We will illustrate this through one case in which reason is used. 
Among the different kinds of unity according to concepts of the understanding 
belongs the causality of a substance, which is called "power."g 
At first glance the various appearances of one and the same substance 
show such diversity that one must assume almost as many powers as 
there are effects, as in the human mind there are sensation, consciousA649/
B677 
ness, imagination, memory, wit, the power to distinguish, pleasure, desire, 
etc. Initially a logical maxim bids us to reduce this apparent variety 
as far as possible by discovering hidden identity through comparison, 
and seeing if imagination combined with consciousness may not be 
memory, wit, the power to distinguish, or perhaps even understanding 
and reason. The idea of a fundamental power -though logic does not 
at all ascertain whether there is such a thing -is at least the problemh

set by a systematic representation of the manifoldness of powers. The 
logical principle of reason demands this unity as far as it is possible to 
bring it about, and the more appearances of this power and that power 
are found to be identical, the more probable it becomes that they are 
nothing but various expressions of one and the same power, which can 
be called (comparatively) their fundamental power. One proceeds in 
just the same way with the rest of the powers. 

These comparatively fundamental powers must once again be compared 
with one another, so as to discover their unanimity and thereby 
bring them close to a single radical, i.e., absolutely fundamental, power. 
But this unity of reason is merely hypothetical. One asserts not that 
such a power must in fact be found, but rather that one must seek it for 
the benefit of reason, namely for setting up certain principles b for the 
A6so/ B 678 many rules with which experience may furnish us, and that where it can 
be done, one must in such a way bring systematic unity into cognition. 

But if one attends to the transcendental use of the understanding, it 
is evident that this idea of a fundamental power in general does not 
functionc merely as a problemd for hypothetical use, but pretends to objective 
reality, so that the systematic unity of a substance's many powers 
are postulated and an apodictic principlee of reason is erected. For even 
without our having attempted to find the unanimity among the many 
powers, or indeed even when all such attempts to discover it have failed, 
we nevertheless presuppose that such a thing will be found; and it is not 
only, as in the case cited, on account of the unity of substance that reason 
presupposes systematic unity among manifold powers, but rather 
reason does so even where many powers, though to a certain degree of 
the same kind, are found, as with matter in general, where particular 
natural laws stand under more general ones; and the parsimony of principlesfis 
not merely a principle of economy for reason, but becomes an 
inner law of its nature. 


In fact it cannot even be seen how there could be a logical principleg 
of rational unity among rules unless a transcendental principleh is presupposed, 
through which such a systematic unity, as pertaining to the 
A6SI/B679 objecti itself, is assumed a priori as necessary. For by what warrant can

which nature gives to our cognition as merely a concealed unity, and to 
derive them as far as it is able from some fundamental power, when reason 
is free to admit that it is just as possible that all powers are different 
in kind, and that its derivation of them from a systematic unity is 
not in conformity with nature? For then reason would proceed directly 
contrary to its vocation, since it would set as its goal an idea that entirely 
contradicts the arrangement of nature. Nor can one say that ita 
has previously gleanedb this unity from the contingent constitution of 
nature in accordance with its principlesc of reason. For the law of reason 
to seek unity is necessary, since without it we would have no reason, 
and without that, no coherentd use of the understanding, and, lacking 
that, no sufficient mark of empirical truth; thus in regard to the latter 
we simply have to presuppose the systematic unity of nature as objectively 
valid and necessary. 

We also find this transcendental presupposition hidden in an admirable 
way in the principles of the philosophers, although they have 
not always recognized it or admitted it to themselves. That all the manifoldness 
of individual things does not exclude the identity of species; 
that the several species must be treated only as various determinations A6S2/B680 
of fewer genera, and the latter of still higher families,' etc.; that therefore 
a certain systematic unity of all possible empirical concepts must be 
sought insofar as they can be derived from higher and more general 
ones: this is a scholastic rule or logical principle! without which there 
could be no use of reason, because we can infer from the universal to 
the particular only on the ground of the universal properties of things 
under which the particular properties stand. 

But that such unanimity is to be encountered even in nature is something 
the philosophers presuppose in the familiar scholastic rule that 
one should not multiply beginnings (principles)': without necessity (entia 
praeter necessitatem non esse multiplicanda).h It is thereby said that the nature 
of things themselves offers material for the unity of reason, and the 
apparently infinite variety should not restrain us from conjecturing behind 
it a unity of fundamental properties, from which their manifoldness 
can be derived only through repeated determination. This unity, 
although it is a mere idea, has been pursued so eagerly in all ages that 
more often there has been cause to moderate than to encourage the de-

sire for it. The analysts had already done much when they were able to 
reduce all salts to two main genera, acidic and alkaline, but they even 
attempted to regard this distinction as merely a variety or varied ex


A653iB681 pression of one and the same fundamental material. They sought to get 
the several species of earths (the material of stone and even of metal) 
gradually down to three, and finally to two; still not satisfied, they could 
not dismiss from their thought the conjecture that behind these varieties 
there is a single genus or even indeed a common principlea for 
both earths and salts. One might have believed that this is merely a device 
of reason for achieving economy, for saving as much trouble as possible, 
and a hypothetical attempt that, if it succeeds, will through this 
unity give probability to the grounds of explanation it presupposed. Yet 
such a selfish aim can easily be distinguished from the idea, in accordance 
with which everyone presupposes that this unity of reason conforms 
to nature itself; and here reason does not beg but commands, 
though without being able to determine the bounds of this unity. 
If among the appearances offering themselves to us there were such 
a great variety -I will not say of form (for they might be similar to one 
another in that) but of content, i.e., regarding the manifoldness of existing 
beings -that even the most acute human understanding, through 
comparison of one with another, could not detect the least similarity (a 
case which can at least be thought), then the logical law of genera would 

A6S4/ B 
682 not obtain at all, no concept of a genus, nor any other universal concept, 
indeed no understanding at all would obtain, since it is the understanding 
that has to do with such concepts. The logical principleb of 
genera therefore presupposes a transcendental one if it is to be applied 
to nature (by which I here understand only objects that are given to us). 
According to that principle, sameness of kind is necessarily presupposed 
in the manifold of a possible experience (even though we cannot determine 
its degree a priori), because without it no empirical concepts and 
hence no experience would be possible. 
To the logical principle r of genera which postulates identity there is 
opposed another, namely that of species, which needs manifoldness 
and variety in things despite their agreement under the same genus, and 
prescribes to the understanding that it be no less attentive to variety 
than to agreement. This principle (of discrimination, or of the faculty 
of distinguishing) severely limits the rashness of the first principle (of 
wit);"7 and here reason shows two interests that conflict with each 
other: on the one side, an interest in the domain (universality) in regard 
to genera, on the other an interest in content (determinacy) in respect

of the manifoldness of species; for in the first case the understanding 
thinks much under its concepts, while in the second it thinks all the 
more in them. This expresses itself in the very different ways of think-A6S5 I B 683 
ing among students of nature; some of whom (who are chiefly speculative) 
are hostile to differences in kind, while others (chiefly empirical 
minds) constantly seek to split nature into so much manifoldness that 
one would almost have to give up the hope of judging its appearances 
according to general principles.a 

This latter way of thinking is also obviously grounded on a logical 
principleb that has as its aim the systematic completeness of all cognitions, 
if, starting with the genus, I descend to whatever manifold may be 
contained under it, and thus in this way seek to secure extension for the 
system, just as in the first case I seek to secure simplicity by ascending 
to the genus. For from the sphere of the concept signifying a genus it 
can no more be seen how far its division will go than it can be seen from 
space how far division will go in the matter that fills it. Hence every 
genus requires different species, and these subspecies, and since none 
of the latter once again is ever without a sphere, (a domain as a conceptus 
communis),' reason demands in its entire extension that no species be regarded 
as in itself the lowest; for since each species is always a concept 
that contains within itself only what is common to different things, this 
concept cannot be thoroughly determined, hence it cannot be related to A6S6/B684 
an individual, consequently, it must at every time contain other concepts, 
i.e., subspecies, under itself. This law of specification could be expressed 
thus: entium varietates non temere esse minuendas. d 

But it is easy to see that even this logical law would be without sense 
or application if it were not grounded on a transcendental law of specification, 
which plainly does not demand an actual infinity in regard to 
the varieties of things that can become our objects -for the logical 
principle asserting the indeterminacy of the logical sphere in regard 
to possible division would give no occasion for that; but it does impose 
on the understanding the demand to seek under every species that 
comes before us for subspecies, and for every variety smaller varieties. 
For if there were no lower concepts, then there would also be no higher 
ones. Now the understanding cognizes everything only through concepts; 
consequently, however far it goes in its divisions, it never cog

d "The varieties of entities are not to be diminished rashly." Clearly this is Kant's attempt

nizes through mere intuition but always yet again through lower concepts. 
The cognition of appearances in their thoroughgoing determinacy 
(which is possible only through understanding) demands a ceaselessly 
continuing specification of its concepts, and a progress to the 
varieties that always still remain, from which abstraction is made in the 
concept of the species and even more in that of the genus. 

A6S7/B68S Also this law of specification cannot be borrowed from experience; 
for experience can make no such extensive disclosures. Empirical specification 
soon stops in distinguishing the manifold, unless through the 
already preceding transcendental law of specification as a principlea of 
reason it is led to seek such disclosures and to keep on assuming them 
even when they do not immediately reveal themselves to the senses. 
That there are absorbent earths of different species (chalky earths and 
muriatic earths) needed for its discovery a foregoing rule of reason that 
made it a task for the understanding to seek for varieties, by presupposing 
nature to be so abundant that it presumes them. For we have an understanding 
only under the presupposition of varieties in nature, just as 
we have one only under the condition that nature's objectsb have in 
themselves a sameness of kind, because it is just the manifoldness of 
what can be grasped together under a concept that constitutes use of 
this concept and the business of the understanding. 
Reason thus prepares the field for the understanding: 1. by a principle< 
of sameness of kind in the manifold under higher genera, 2. by a 
principle of the variety of what is same in kind under lower species; and 
in order to complete the systematic unity it adds 3. still another law of 
the affinity of all concepts, which offers a continuous transition from 

A6S8/B686 every species to every other through a graduated increase of varieties. 
We can call these the principlesd of the homogeneity, specification 
and continuity of forms. The last arises by uniting the first two, according 
as one has completed the systematic connection in the idea by 
ascending to higher genera, as well as descending to lower species; for 
then all manifolds are akine one to another, because they are all collectively 
descended/ through every degree of extended determination, 
from a single highest genus. 
Systematic unity under the three logical principlesg can be made palpableh 
in the following way. One can regard every concept as a point,

which, as the standpoint of an observer, has its horizon, i.e., a multiplicity 
of things that can be represented and surveyed, as it were, from 
it. Within this horizon a multiplicity of points must be able to be given 
to infinity, each of which in turn has its narrower field of view; i.e., 
every species contains subspecies in accordance with the principle a of 
specification, and the logical horizon consists only of smaller horizons 
(subspecies), but not of points that have no domain (individuals). But 
different horizons, i.e., genera, which are determined from just as 
many concepts, one can think as drawn out into a common horizon, A6S9/ B 687 
which one can survey collectively from its middle point, which is the 
higher genus, until finally the highest genus is the universal and true 
horizon, determined from the standpoint of the highest concept and 
comprehending all manifoldness, as genera, species, and subspecies, 
under itself. 
The law of homogeneity leads me to this highest standpoint, while 
the law of specification leads to all the lower ones and their greatest 
possible variety. Since, however, in such a way nothing in the entire domain 
of all possible concepts is empty, and outside it nothing can be encountered, 
there arises from the presupposition of that universal field of 
view and its thoroughgoing division the principle: non datur vacuum formarum,
b i.e., there are no different original and primary genera, which 
would be, as it were, isolated and separated from one another (by an 
empty intervening space), but rather all the manifold genera are only 
partitioningsC of a single supreme and universal genus; and from this 
principle its immediate consequence: datur continuum formarum,d i.e., all 
varieties of species bound one another and permit no transition to one 
another by a leap, but only through every smaller degree of distinction, 
so that from each one can reach another; in a word, there are no species 
or subspecies that are proximate (in the concept of reason), but intervening 
species are always possible, whose difference from the first and 
second species is smaller than their difference from each other. A66o/ B 688 
The first law, therefore, guards against excess in the manifold variety 
of original genera, and recommends sameness of kind; the second, on 
the contrary, limits in turn this inclination to unanimity, and demands 
that one distinguish subspecies before one turns to the individuals with 
one's universal concepts. The third law unites the first two, prescribing 
even in the case of the highest manifoldness a sameness of kind through 
the graduated transition from one species e to others, which shows a

kind of affinity a of various branches, insofar as they have all sprouted 
from one stem. 

This logical law of the continuum specierum (formarum logicarum) b 
presupposes, however, a transcendental law (lex continui in natura),c 
without which the use of the understanding through the former prescription 
would only mislead, since the prescription would perhaps take 
a path directly opposed to nature. This law must therefore rest on pure 
transcendental and not empirical grounds. For in the latter case it 
would come later than the systems; but it really first produced what is 
systematic in the cognition of nature. Behind these laws there is also 
nothing like a hidden intention to initiate probes, as mere experiments, 

A66r / B 689 though plainly this interconnection, where it applies, gives us a powerful 
reason to take as well grounded the unity that is hypothetically 
thought-out, and thus it has its utility in this respect; rather, one can see 
clearly that the laws judge the parsimony of fundamental causes, the 
manifoldness of effects, and the consequent affinityd of the members of 
nature in themselves reasonably and in conformity with nature, and 
these principles therefore carry their recommendation directly in themselves, 
e and not merely as methodological devices. 
But it is easy to see that this continuity of forms is a mere idea, for 
which a corresponding object can by no means be displayed in experience, 
not only because the species! in nature are really partitioned and 
therefore in themselves have to constitute a quantum discretum, g and if 
the graduated progress in their affinityh were continuous, they would 
also have to contain a true infinity of intermediate members between 
any two given species, which is impossible; but also because we could 
make no determinate empirical use at all of this law, since through it 
there is indicated not the least mark of that affinity, or how and how far 
we are to seek the degrees of its variety; rather, we are given nothing 
more than a general indication that we are to seek for it. 

A662/B690 If we transpose the principlesi we have adduced, so as to put them in 
an order which accords with their experiential use, then the principlesi 
of systematic unity would stand something like this: manifold

ness, affinity, a unity, each taken, however, as ideab in the highest de


gree of their completeness. Reason presupposes those cognitions of the 

understanding which are first applied to experience, and seeks the unity 

of these cognitions in accordance with ideas that go much further than 

experience can reach. The affinity C of the manifold, without detriment 

to its variety, under a principled of unity, concerns not merely the 

things, but even more the mere properties and powers of things. Hence 

if, e.g., the course of the planets is given to us as circular through a (still 

not fully corrected) experience, and we find variations, then we suppose 

these variations to consist in an orbit that can deviate from the circle 

through each of an infinity of intermediate degrees according to con


stant laws; i.e., we suppose that the movements of the planets that are 

not a circle will more or less approximate to its properties, and then we 

come upon the ellipse. The comets show an even greater variety in their 

paths, since (as far as observation reaches) they do not ever return in a 

circle; yet we guess at a parabolic course for them, since it is still akin' 

to the ellipse and, if the major axis of the latter is very long, it cannot 

be distinguished from it in all our observations. Thus under the guid-A663/B691 

ance of those principles fwe come to a unity of genera in the forms of 

these paths, but thereby also further to unity in the cause of all the laws 

of this motion (gravitation); from there we extend our conquests, seek


ing to explain all variations and apparent deviations from those rules on 

the basis of the same principle;g finally we even add on more than ex


perience can ever confirm, namely in accordance with the rules of affin-

ity,h even conceiving hyperbolical paths for comets in which these 

bodies leave our solar system entirely and, going from sun to sun, unite 

in their course the most remote parts of a world system, which for us is 

unbounded yet connected through one and the same moving force.i 
What is strange about these principles,i and what alone concerns us, 
is this: that they seem to be transcendental, and even though they contain 
mere ideas to be followed in the empirical use of reason, which 
reason can follow only asymptotically, as it were, i.e., merely by ap

proximation, without ever reaching them, yet these principles,a as synthetic 
propositions a priori, nevertheless have objective but indeterminate 
validity, and serve as a rule of possible experience, and can even be 
used with good success, as heuristic principles, in actually elaborating it; 
and yet one cannot bring about a transcendental deduction of them, 

A664/B692 which, as has been proved above, is always impossible in regard to ideas. 
In the Transcendental Analytic we have distinguished among the 
principles of understanding the dynamical ones, as merely regulative 
principlesb of intuition, from the mathematical ones, which are constitutive 
in regard to intuition. Despite this, the dynamical laws we are 
thinking of are stilI constitutive in regard to experience, since they 
make possible a priori the concepts without which there is no experience. 
Principlesc of pure reason, on the contrary, cannot be constitutive 
even in regard to empirical concepts, because for them no corresponding 
schema of sensibility can be given, and therefore they can 
have no object in concreto. Now ifI depart from such an empirical use of 
them, as constitutive principles, how will I nevertheless secure for them 
a regulative use, and with this some objective validity? And what sort of 
meaningd can that use have? 
The understanding constitutes an object for reason, just as sensibility 
does for the understanding. To make systematic the unity of all possible 
empirical actions of the understanding is a business of reason, just as the 
understanding connects the manifold of appearances through concepts 
and brings it under empirical laws. The actions of the understanding, 
however, apart from the schemata of sensibility, are undetermined; 

A66S! B 693 likewise the unity of reason is also in itself undetermined in regard to 
the conditions under which, and the degree to which, the understanding 
should combine its concepts systematically. Yet although no schema 
can be found in intuition for the thoroughgoing systematic unity of all 
concepts of the understanding, an analogue of such a schema can and 
must be given, which is the idea of the maximum of division and unification 
of the understanding's cognition in one principle! For that 
which is greatest and most complete may be kept determinately in 
mind! because all restricting conditions, which give indeterminate 
manifolds, are omitted. Thus the idea of reason is an analogue of a 
schema of sensibility, but with this difference, that the application of 
concepts of the understanding to the schema of reason is not likewise a

cognition of the object itself (as in the application of the categories to 
their sensible schemata), but only a rule or principlea of the systematic 
unity of all use of the understanding. Now since every principle that establishes 
for the understanding a thoroughgoing unity of its use apriori 
is also valid, albeit only indirectly, for the object of experience, the principles 
of pure reason will also have objective reality in regard to this object, 
yet not so as to detennine something in it, but only to indicate the 
procedure in accordance with which the empirical and determinate use 
of the understanding in experience can be brought into thoroughgoing A666/B694 
agreementwith itself, by bringing it as far as possible into connection 
with the principleb of thoroughJoing unity; and from that it is derived. 

I call all subjective principles that are taken not from the constitution 
of the objectC but from the interest of reason in regard to a certain pos


lI8

sible perfection of the cognition of this object,d maxims of reason. 
Thus there are maxims of speculative reason, which rest solely on reason's 
speculative interest, even though it may seem as if they were objective 
principles. e 


If merely regulative principles are considered as constitutive, then as 
objective principles! they can be in conflict; but if one considers them 
merely as maxims, then it is not a true conflict, but it is merely a different 
interest of reason that causes a divorce between ways of thinking.
g Reason has in fact only a single unifiedh interest, and the conflict 
between its maxims is only a variation and a reciprocal limitation of the 
methods satisfying this interest. 

In this way the interest in manifoldness (in accordance with the 
principlei of specification) might hold more for this sophistical reasoner/ 
while unity (in accordance with the principlek of aggregation) 
holds more for that one. Each of them believes that his judgment 
comes from insight into the object,' and yet he grounds it solely on the A667/B695 

greater or lesser attachment to one of the two principles, neither of 

which rests on any objective grounds, but only on the interest of reason, 
and that could better be called "maxims" than "principles."m If I see

insightful men in conflict with one another over the characteristics of 
human beings, animals or plants, or even of bodies in the mineral realm, 
where some, e.g., assume particular characters of peoples based on their 
descent or on decisive and hereditary distinctions between families, 
races, etc., while others, by contrast, fix their minds on the thought that 
nature has set up no predispositions at all in this matter, and that all differences 
rest only on external contingency, then I need only consider 
the constitution of the object in order to comprehend that it lies too 
deeply hidden for either of them to be able to speak from an insight into 
the nature of the object.o There is nothing here but the twofold interest 
of reason, where each party takes to heart one interest or the other, 
or affects to do so, hence either the maxim of the manifoldness of nature 
or that of the unity of nature; these maxims can of course be united, 
but as long as they are held to be objective insights, they occasion not 
only conflict but also hindrances that delay the discovery of the truth, 

A668/B696 until a means is found of uniting the disputedb interests and satisfying 
reason about them. 
It is the same with the assertion of, or the attack on, the widely respected 
law of the ladder of continuityc among creatures, made current 
by Leibniz"9 and excellently supported by Bonnet,'20 which is 
nothing but a pursuit of the principle of affinity resting on the interests 
of reason; for observation and insight into the arrangements of nature 
could never provide it as something to be asserted objectively. The 
rungs of such a ladder, such as experience can give them to us, stand too 
far apart from one another, and what we presume to be small differences 
are commonly such wide gaps in nature itself that on the basis of 
such observations (chiefly of the great manifoldness of things, among 
which it must always be easy to find certain similarities and approximations) 
nothing can be figured out about the intentions of nature. The 
method for seeking out order in nature in accord with such a principle,d 
on the contrary, and the maxim of regarding such an order as grounded 
in nature in general, even though it is undetermined where or to what 
extent, is a legitimate and excellent regulative principle' of reason, 
which, however, as such, goes much too far for experience or observation 
ever to catch up with it; without determining anything, it only 
pointsf the way toward systematic unity.

On the final aim of the natural dialectic 
of human reason 


The ideas of pure reason can never be dialectical in themselves; rather 
it is merely their misuse which brings it about that a deceptive illusion 
arises out of them; for they are given as problems for us by the nature 
of our reason, and this highest court of appeals for all rights and claims 
of our speculation cannot possibly contain original deceptions and semblances. 
Presumably, therefore, they have their good and purposive vocation 
in regard to the natural predisposition of our reason. But as usual 
the mob of sophists makes a hue and cry over absurdities and contradictions 
and rails at the regime whose inmost plans they are unable to 
penetrate, although they too have its benevolent influences to thank for 
their preservation and even for the culture which puts them in a position 
to blame and condemn. 

One cannot avail oneself of a concept a priori with any security unless 
one has brought about a transcendental deduction of it. The ideas of 
reason, of course, do not permit any deduction of the same kind as the 
categories; but if they are to have the least objective validity, even if it 
is only an indeterminate one, and are not to represent merely empty 
thought-entities (entia rationis ratiocinantis),a then a deduction of them A67o/B698 
must definitely be possible, granted that it must also diverge quite far 
from the deduction one can carry out in the case of the categories. That 
deduction is the completion of the critical business of pure reason, and 
it is what we will now undertake. 

It makes a big difference whether something is given to my reason as 
an object absolutely or is given only as an object in the idea. In the 
first case my concepts go as far as determining the object; but in the second, 
there is really only a schema for which no object is given, not even 
hypothetically, but which serves only to represent other objects to us, in 
accordance with their systematic unity, by means of the relation to this 
idea, hence to represent these objects indirectly. Thus I say the concept 
of a highest intelligence is a mere idea, i.e., its objective reality is not to 
consist in the fact that it relates straightway to an object (for in such a 
signification we would not be able to justify its objective validity); rather, 
it is only a schema, ordered in accordance with the conditions of the 
greatest unity of reason, for the concept of a thing in general, which 

a Gedankenwesen; beings of sophistical reason 


605 



Doctrine of Elements. Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. III 

serves only to preserve the greatest systematic unity in the empirical use 

of our reason, in that one derives the object of experience, as it were, 

from the imagined object of this idea as its ground or cause. Then it is 

A671 /B699 said, e.g., that the things in the world must be considered as if they had 
gotten their existence from a highest intelligence. In such a way the idea 
is only a heuristic and not an ostensive concept; and it shows not how an 
object is constituted but how, under the guidance of that concept, we 
ought to seek after the constitution and connection of objects of experience 
in general. Now if one can show that although the three kinds of 
transcendental ideas (psychological, a cosmological and theological) 
cannot be referred directly to any object corresponding to them and to 
its determination, and nevertheless that all rules of the empirical use of 
reason under the presupposition of such an object in the idea lead to 
systematic unity, always extending the cognition of experience but never 
going contrary to experience, then it is a necessary maxim of reason to 
proceed in accordance with such ideas. And this is the transcendental 
deduction of all the ideas of speculative reason, not as constitutive principlesb 
for the extension of our cognition to more objects than experience 
can give, but as regulative principlesc for the systematic unity of 
the manifold of empirical cognition in general, through which this cognition, 
within its proper boundaries, is cultivated and corrected d more 
than could happen without such ideas, through the mere use of the principles 
of understanding. 


A672/B700 I will make this clearer. Following the ideas named above as principles, 
e we will first (in psychology) connect all appearances, actions, and 
receptivity of our mind to the guiding thread of inner experience as if 
the mind were a simple substance that (at least in this life) persists in existence 
with personal identity, while its states -to which the states of 
the body belong only as external conditions -are continuously changing. 
Then second (in cosmology) we have to pursue the conditions of 
the inner as well as the outer appearances of nature through an investigation 
that will nowhere be completed, as if nature were infinite in 
itself and without a first or supreme member -although, without denying, 
outside of all appearances, the merely intelligible primary grounds 
for them, we may never bring these grounds into connection with explanations 
of nature, because we are not acquainted with them at all. 
Finally and thirdly, (in regard to theology) we have to consider every

thing that might ever belong to the context of possible experience as if 
this experience constituted an absolute unity, but one dependent 
through and through, and always still conditioned within the world of 
sense, yet at the same time as if the sum total of all appearances (the 
world of sense itself) had a single supreme and all-sufficient ground 
outside its range, namely an independent, original, and creative reason, 

as it were, in relation to which we direct every empirical use of our rea-A673 / B 701 

son in its greatest extension as if the objects themselves had arisen from 

that original image of all reason. That means: it is not from a simple 

thinking substance that we derive the inner appearances of our soul, but 

from one another in accordance with the idea of a simple being; it is not 

from a highest intelligence that we derive the order of the world and its 

systematic unity, but rather it is from the idea of a most wise cause that 

we take the rule that reason is best off using for its own satisfaction 

when it connects up causes and effects in the world. 
Now there is not the least thing to hinder us from assuming these 
ideas as objective and hypostatic, except only the cosmological ones, 
where reason runs up against an antinomy when it tries to bring this 
about (the psychological and theological ideas contain nothing of that 
sort at all). For there is no contradiction in them, so how could anyone 
dispute their objective reality, since he knows just as little about their 
possibility in denying it as we do in affirming it? Nevertheless, in order 
to assume something it is not enough that there is no positive hindrance 
to doing so, and we cannot be allowed to introduce mere thoughtentitiesa 
that transcend all our concepts, though they contradict none 
of them, as real and determinate objects merely on credit, just so that 
speculative reason can complete its business as it likes. Thus they A674/B 702 
should not be assumed in themselves, but their reality should hold only 
as that of a schema of the regulative principleb for the systematic unity 
of all cognitions of nature; hence they should be grounded only as analogues 
of real things, but not as things in themselves. We remove from 
the object of an idea those conditions that limit our concept of the understanding, 
but that also make it possible for us to be able to have a 
determinate concept of any thing. And now we are thinking of a Something 
about which we have no concept at all of how it is in itself, but 
about which we think a relation to the sum total of appearances, which 
is analogous to the relation that appearances have to one another. 
If, accordingly, we assume such ideal entities, then we do not really 

extend our cognition beyond the objects c of possible experience, but 

a Gedankenwesen 
b Princip 
, Objecte 


607

only extend the empirical unity of these objects a through the systematic 
unity for which the idea gives us the schema; hence the idea holds not 
as a constitutive but merely as a regulative principle. b For that we posit 
a thing corresponding to the idea, a Something or a real being -by this 
fact it is not said that we would extend our cognition of things with 
transcendental concepts; this being is grounded only in the idea and not 
in itself, hence only in order to express the systematic unity which is to 

A675 IB 703 serve us as the standard for the empirical use of reason, without settling 
anything about what the ground of this unity is, or about the inner 
property of such a being on which, as cause, it rests. 
Thus the transcendental and single determinate concept of God that 
merely speculative reason gives us is in the most precise sense deistic, 
i.e., reason does not furnish us with the objective validity of such a concept, 
but only with the idea of something on which all empirical reality 
grounds its highest and necessary unity, and which we cannot think except 
in accordance with the analogy of an actual substance that is the 
cause of all things according to laws of reason; of course this is insofar 
as we undertake to think it as a particular object at all, and do not, content 
with the mere idea of the regulative principle of reason, rather 
prefer to set aside the completion of all conditions of thought as too extravagantd 
for human understanding; but that is not consistent with the 
aim of a perfect systematic unity in our cognition, to which reason at 
least sets no limits. 
Hence now it happens that if I assume a divine being, I do not have 
the least concept either of the inner possibility of such a highest per


A6761 B 704 fection or of the necessity of its existence; but then I can deal satisfactorily 
with all other questions concerning the contingent, and reason 
can obtain the most perfect satisfaction in regard to the greatest unity 
for which it is searching in its empirical use, but not in regard to the 
presupposition itself; this proves that it is reason's speculative interest 
and not its insight which justifies it in starting from a point lying so 
far beyond its sphere in order to consider its objects in one complete 
whole. 
Now here, regarding one and the same presupposition, a distinction 
reveals itself between ways of thinking which is rather subtle but nevertheless 
of great importance for transcendental philosophy. I can have a 
satisfactory reason for assuming something relatively (suppositio relativa) 
without being warranted in assuming it absolutely (suppositio absoluta). 
This distinction is pertinent when we have to do merely with a regula


a Objecte 
b Princip 
, Princip 
d uberschwenglich 

608 



Section VII. Critique of all speculative theology 

tive principle/ which we recognize as necessary, but whose source we do 
not know,b and for which we assume a supreme ground merely with the 
intention of thinking the universality of the principlec all the more determinately, 
as, e.g., when I think as existing a being that corresponds to 
a mere and indeed transcendental idea. For here I can never assume the 
existence of this thing in itself, because none of the concepts through 

which I can think any object determinately will attain to it, and the con-A677! B 705 

ditions for the objective validity of my concepts are excluded by the idea 

itself. The concepts of reality, substance, causality, even that of necessity 

in existence have, beyond their use in making possible the empirical 

cognition of an object, no significance at all which might determine any 

object.d They can therefore be used for explaining the possibility of 

things in the world of sense, but not the possibility of a world-whole 

itself, because this ground of explanation would have to be outside the 

world and hence it would not be an object of a possible experience. Now 

I can nevertheless assume such an incomprehensible being, the object of 

a mere idea, relative to the world of sense, though not in itself. For if the 

greatest possible empirical use of my reason is grounded on an idea (that 

of systematic complete unity, about which I will have more to say 

presently), which in itself can never be presented adequately in experi


ence, even tllOugh it is unavoidably necessary for approximating to the 

highest possible degree of empirical unity, then I am not only warranted 

but even compelled to realize this idea, i.e., to posit for it an actual ob


ject, but only as a Something in general with which I am not acquainted 

at all and to which, as a ground of that systematic unity and in relation 

to that, I give such properties as are analogous to the concepts of the un-A678!B 706 

derstanding in their empirical use. Thus according to the analogy of re


alities in the world, of substances, causality, and necessity, I will think of 

a being that possesses all of these in their highest perfection, and since 

this idea rests merely on my reason, I am able to think this being as self


sufficient reason, which is the cause of the world-whole through ideas 

of the greatest harmony and unity; thus I leave out all conditions limit


ing the idea, so as -under the auspicese of such an original ground -to 

make possible systematic unity of the manifold in the world-whole and, 

by means of this unity, the greatest possible empirical use of reason, by 

seeing all combinations as if they were ordained by a highest reason of 

which our reason is only a weak copy. Then I think this highest reason 

through mere concepts, which really have their application only in the 

609 

a Princip 
h erkennen 
, Princip 
d Object 
, Schutze

world of sense; but since I put that transcendental presupposition to no 
other use but a relative one -namely that it should give the substratum 
for the greatest possible unity of experience -I may very well think a 
being that I distinguish from the world through properties which belong 
solely to the world of sense. For by no means do I require, nor am 
I warranted in requiring, cognition of this object of my idea as to what 
it might be in itself; for I have no concepts for that, and even the con


A679/ B 707 cepts of reality, substance, causality, indeed even necessity in existence, 
lose all meaninga and are empty titles for concepts without any content 
when with them I venture outside the field of sense. I think only the relationb 
which a being, in itself unknown to me, has to the greatest systematic 
unity of the world-whole, and this is solely in order to make it 
into the schema of a regulative principle< for the greatest possible empirical 
use of my reason. 
If we now cast our glance over the transcendental object of our idea, 
then we see that we cannot presuppose its actuality in accordance with 
the concepts of reality, substance, causality, etc., in itself, because these 
concepts have not the least application to something that is entirely different 
from the world of sense. Thus reason's suppositiond of a highest 
being as the supreme cause is thought merely relatively, on behalf of the 
systematic unity of the world of sense, and it is a mere Something in the 
idea, of which we have no concept of what it is in itself. This also explains 
why, in relation to that which is given to the senses as existing, 
we need the idea of a being which is necessary in itself, but can never 
have the least concept of this being and its absolute necessity. 
Now we can place the result of the entire Transcendental Dialectic 

A680/B 708 clearly before our eyes, and precisely determine the final aim of the 
ideas of pure reason, which become dialectical only through misunderstanding 
and carelessness. Pure reason is in fact concerned with nothing 
but itself, and it can have no other concern, because what is given 
to it is not objects to be unified for the concept of experience, but cognitions 
of understanding to be unified for the concept of reason, i.e., to 
be connected in one principle.' The unity of reason is the unity of a system, 
and this systematic unity does not serve reason objectively as a 
principle, extending it over objects, but subjectively as a maxim, in 
order to extend it over all possible empirical cognition of objects. 
Nevertheless, the systematic connection that reason can give to the empirical 
use of the understanding furthers not only its extension but also

Section VII. Critique of all speculative theology 

guarantees its correctness, and the principle a of such a systematic unity 
is also objective but in an indeterminate way (principium vagum):b not as 
a constitutive principle' for determining something in regard to its direct 
object, but rather as a merely regulative principle and maxim for 
furthering and strengthening the empirical use of reason by opening up 
new paths into the infinite (the undetermined) with which the understanding 
is not acquainted, yet without ever being the least bit contrary 
to the laws of its empirical use. 

But reason cannot think this systematic unity in any other way than A 68 II B 709 
by giving its idea an object, which, however, cannot be given through 
any experience; for experience never gives an example of perfect systematic 
unity. Now this being of reason (ens rationis ratiocinatae)d is, to 
be sure, a mere idea, and is therefore not assumed absolutely and in itself 
as something actual, but is rather taken as a ground only problematically 
(because we cannot reach it through any concepts of the 
understanding), so as to regard all the connection of things in the world 
of sense as if they had their ground in this being of reason; but solely 
with the intention of grounding on it the systematic unity that is indispensable 
to reason and conducive in every way to empirical cognition 
of the understanding but can never be obstructive to it. 

One mistakes the significance of this idea right away if one takes it to 
be the assertion, or even only the presupposition, of an actual thinge to 
which one would think of ascribing the ground for the systematic constitution 
of the world; rather, one leaves it entirely open what sort of 
constitution in itself this ground, which eludes our concepts, might 
have, and posits an idea only as a unique standpoint from which alone 
one can extend the unity that is so essential to reason and so salutary to 
the understanding; in a word, this transcendental thing is merely the A682/B7IO 
schema of that regulative principle! through which reason, as far as it 
can, extends systematic unity over all experience. 

The first objectg of such an idea is I myself, considered merely as 
thinking nature (soul). If I want to seek out the properties with which a 
thinking thing exists in itself, then I have to ask experience, and I cannot 
even apply any of the categories to this object except insofar as its 
schema is given in sensible intuition. By this means, however, I will 
never attain to a systematic unity of all the appearances of inner sense. 
Thus instead of the concept of experience (of that which the soul actu

ally is), which cannot lead us very far, reason takes the concept of the 
empirical unity of all thought, and, by thinking this unity unconditionally 
and originally, it makes out of it a concept of reason (an idea) of a 
simple substance, unchangeable in itself (identical in personality), 
standing in community with other real things outside it -in a word, the 
concept of a simple self-sufficient intelligence. With this, however, reason 
has nothing before its eyes except principles a of the systematic unity 
in explaining the appearances of the soul, namely by considering all determinations 
as in one subject, all powers, as far as possible, as derived 
from one unique fundamental power, all change as belonging to the 
A683/B7II states of one and the same persisting being, and by representing all appearances 
in space as entirely distinct from the actions of thinking. 
That simplicity of substance, etc., ought to be only the schema for this 
regulative principle,b and it is not presupposed as if it were the real 
ground of properties of the soul. For these properties could rest on entirely 
different grounds, with which we are not acquainted at all, just as 
we might not really be able to cognize the soul at all through these assumed 
predicates even if we let them hold of it absolutely, since they 
constitute a mere idea that cannot be represented in concreto at all. Now 
nothing but advantage can arise from such a psychological idea, if only 
one guards against letting it hold as something more than a mere idea, 
i.e., if one lets it hold merely relative to the systematic use of reason in 
respect of the appearances of our soul. For then empirical laws of corporeal 
appearances, which are of an entirely different species, will not 
be mixed up in the explanation of what belongs merely toC inner sense; 
then no windy hypotheses about the generation, destruction or palingenesis'
2' of souls, etc., will be admitted; a consideration of this object 
of inner sense as a whole will d therefore be instituted, and this will not 
be mixed up with properties of any different kind; moreover, the investigation 
of reason will be directed to carrying through the grounds of 
explanation in this subject as far as possible on the basis of a single prin


A684/B 712 ciple;e all of this is best effected through such a schema just as ifit were 
an actual being -indeed, it can be effected only and solely in this way. 
The psychological idea can also signity nothing other than the schema 
of a regulative concept. For if I wanted only to ask whether the soul is 
not in itself of a spiritual nature, this question would have no sense at 
all. For through such a concept I would take away not merely corporeal 
nature, but all nature whatever, i.e., all predicates of any possible expe

rience, hence all conditions for thinking an object for such a concept, 

which alone and solely makes it possible for one to say that it has any 
sense. 
The second regulative idea of merely speculative reason is the concept 
of the world in general. For nature is really the single given objecta 
in regard to which reason needs regulative principles.b This nature is 
twofold: either thinking nature or corporeal nature. Yet to think of the 
latter as regards its inner possibility, i.e., to determine the application of 


the categories to it, we do not need any idea, i.e., any representation 
transcending experience; no such representation is possible in regard to 
it, because here we are guided merely by sensible intuition -not as with 
the fundamental psychological concept (the I), which contains a priori 
a certain form of thinking, namely its unity. Thus for pure reason there 

is nothing left to us except nature in general, and the completeness of A68S/B713 
conditions in it in accordance with some one principle.c The absolute 
totality of the series of these conditions in the derivation of their mem


bers is an idea which of course can never come about fully in the empirical 
use of reason, but nevertheless serves as a rule for the way we 
ought to proceed in regard to them: namely that in the explanation of 
given appearances (in a regress or ascent), we ought to proceed as ifthe 
series were in itself infinite, i.e., proceed in indefinitum;'22 but where 
reason itself is considered as the determining cause (in the case of freedom), 
hence in the case of practical principles,d we should proceed as if 
we did not have before us an objecte of sense but one of pure under


standing, where the conditions can no longer be posited in the series of 
appearances, but are posited outside it, and the series of states can be 
regarded as if it began absolutely (through an intelligible cause); all this 
proves that the cosmological ideas are nothing but regulative principles/ 
and are far from positing, as it were constitutively, an actual totality 
in such series. The rest one can seek in its place in the Antinomy 
of Pure Reason. 12 3 
The third idea of pure reason, which contains a merely relative suppositiong 
of a being as the sole and all-sufficient cause of all cosmological 
series, is the rational concept of God. We do not have the least A686/B714

idea; for what could enable or even justify us in believing or asserting a

being having the highest perfection, and its nature as necessarily existent, 
merely on the basis of its concept, were it not the world in relation 
to which alone this suppositiona can be necessary? And that shows 
clearly that the idea of that being, like all speculative ideas, means nothing 
more than that reason bids us consider every connection in the 
world according to principlesb of a systematic unity, hence as if they 
had all arisen from one single all-encompassing being, as supreme and 
all-sufficient cause. From this it is clear that here reason could aim at 
nothing except its own formal rule in the extension of its empirical use, 
but never at an extension of it beyond all the boundaries of empirical 
use, consequently, that under this idea there does not lie hidden any 
constitutive principle< for its use directed to possible experience. 

This highest formal unity that alone rests on concepts of reason is 
the purposive unity of things; and the speculative interest of reason 
makes it necessary to regard every ordinance in the world as if it had 
sprouted from the intention of a highest reason. Such a principle,d 

A687/B 7I5 namely, opens up for our reason, as applied to the field of experience, 
entirely new prospects for connecting up things in the world in accordance 
with teleological laws, and thereby attaining to the greatest 
systematic unity among them. The presupposition of a supreme intelligence, 
as the sole cause of the world-whole, but of course merely in 
the idea, can therefore always be useful to reason and never harmful to 
it. Thus if in regard to the shapee of the earth (which is round but 
somewhat flattened),* we presuppose the mountains, seas, etc., to be 
wise intentions of a world-author, then in this way we can make a lot of 
discoveries. As long as we keep to this presupposition as a regulative 
principle,! then even error cannot do us any harm. For then nothing 

* The advantage created by the earth's spherical shape is well known; but few 
know that its flattening as a spheroid is the only thing preventing the elevations 
on the dry land, or even smaller mountains perhaps thrown up by earthquakes, 
from continuously displacing the earth's axis and perhaps appreciably 
so in not too long a time; this might happen if the swelling out of the earth at 
the equator were not such a mighty mountain that the centrifugal forceg of 
every other mountain can never noticeably bring it out of place in regard to 
its axis. And yet without scruples we explain this wise arrangement from the 
equilibrium of the formerly fluid mass of the earth.

more can follow from it in any case than that where we expected a tele


ological connection (nexus finalis), a merely mechanical or physical one 
(nexus effectivus) is to be found; in such a case we only miss one more A688/Bi716 
unity, but we do not ruin the unity of reason in its empirical use. But 
even this setback cannot at all affect the law itself, in its universal and 
teleological aim. For although an anatomist can be convicted of error 

when he relates some organ of an animal's body to an end which, as one 
can clearly show, does not follow from it, it is nevertheless quite impossible 
to prove in anyhone case that a natural arrangement, whatever 
it might be, has no end at all. Hence (medical) physiology extends its 
very limited empirical acquaintance with the ends served by the structure 
of an organic body through a principle prompted merely by pure 
reason -and this to such an extent that it is assumed confidently, and 
with the agreement of all who understand the matter, that everything 
in an animal has its utility and good aim; this presupposition, if it is 
supposed to be constitutive, goes much further than previous observation 
can justify; from this it can be seen that it is nothing but a regulative 
principle a of reason for attaining to the highest systematic unity by 
means of the idea of the purposive causality of the supreme cause of the 
world, as if this being, as the highest intelligence, were the cause of 

everything according to the wisest aim. 
But if we depart from this restriction of the idea to a merely regulative A689/ B 7 I 7 
use, then reason will be misled in several ways, by forsaking the ground 
of experience, which has to contain the markers for its course, and by 
venturing beyond experience into the incomprehensible and inscrutable, 
in whose heights it necessarily becomes dizzy because from this standpoint 
it sees itself entirely cut off from every use attuned to experience. 
The first mistake that arises from using the idea of a highest being 

not merely regulatively but (contrary to the nature of an idea) constitu


tively, is that of lazy reason (ignava ratio).* One can use this term for 

any principle that makes one regard his investigation into nature, what


ever it may be, as absolutely complete, so that reason can take a rest, as A690/ B 7 I 8 

though it had fully accomplished its business. Hence the psychological 

idea too, if it is used as a constitutive principleb to explain the appear

whether you employ a physician or not.I24 Cicero says that this way of inferring

reason without any use in life. I2 5 This is why I record the sophistical argument 
of pure reason using the same name.

ances of our soul, and then further to extend our cognition of this subject 
beyond all experience (to its state after death), makes things very 
convenient for reason, but also completely ruins and destroys every natural 
use of reason according to the guidance of experience. Thus the 
dogmatic spiritualist explains the unity of the person, which consists in 
remaining unaltered through all changes in its states, by the unity of a 
thinking substance, which he thinks he perceives immediately in the 
"I," and he explains the interest we take in things that are supposed to 
come to pass only after our death from the consciousness of the immaterial 
nature of our thinking subject, etc.; he presumes to dispense with 
all the natural investigation of the cause of these inner appearances of 
ours from physical grounds of explanation by, as it were, passing over 
the immanent sources of cognition in experience through an edict as it 
were of a transcendent reason, which makes things comfortable for him 
but also forfeits all insight. These disadvantageous consequences come 
to view even more clearly in the case of the dogmatism of our idea of 
a highest intelligence and the theological system of nature (physicoA69I/
B719 theology) that is falsely grounded on it. For there all the ends showing 
themselves in nature, which are often only made up by us, serve only to 
make it extremely convenient for us in our search for causes, so that instead 
of seeking them in the universal laws of the mechanism of matter, 
we appeal right away to the inscrutable decree of the highest wisdom, 
and regard the toil of reason as completed when in fact the use of reason 
has been completely dispensed with -a use which finds its guiding 
thread nowhere unless it is provided to us by the order of nature and 
the series of alterations according to their internal and more general 
laws. This mistake can be avoided if we do not consider from the viewpoint 
of ends merely a few parts of nature, e.g., the distribution of dry 
land, its structure and the constitution and situation of mountains, or 
even only the organization of the vegetable and animal kingdoms, but 
if we rather make the systematic unity of nature entirely universal in 
relation to the idea of a highest intelligence. For then we make a purposiveness 
in accordance with universal laws of nature the ground, from 
which no particular arrangement is excepted, but arrangements are designated 
only in a way that is more or less discernible by us; then we have 
a regulative principlea of the systematic unity of a teleological connection, 
which, however, we do not determine beforehand, but may only 

A692 / B 720 expect while pursuing the physical-mechanical connection according to 
universal laws. For only in this way can the principleb of purposive unity 
always extend the use of reason in regard to experience without doing 
damage to it in any individual case.

The second mistake that arises from the misinterpretation of the intended 
principlea of systematic unity is that of perverted reason (perversa 
ratio, VOTEQOV :1TQaTEQov rationis). b The idea of systematic unity should 
only serve as a regulative principle for seeking this unity in the combination 
of things in accordance with universal laws of nature, and to the 
extent that something of the sort is encountered in an empirical way, 
one should believe oneself to have approximated to completeness in its 
use, though one obviously will never reach it. Instead of this, one reverses 
the matter and begins by grounding things hypostatically on the 
actuality of a principled of purposive unity; because it is entirely inscrutable, 
the concept of such a highest intelligence is determined anthropomorphically, 
and then one imposes ends on nature forcibly and 
dictatorially, instead of seeking for them reasonably on the path of 
physical investigation, so that teleology, which ought to serve only to 
supplement the unity of nature in accordance with universal laws, not 
only works to do away with it, but even deprives reason of its end, A693/B72I 
namely proving the existence of such an intelligent supreme cause from 
nature according to this end. For if one cannot presuppose the highest 
purposiveness in nature a priori, i.e., as belonging to the essence of nature, 
then how can one be assigned to seek it out and, following the ladder 
of purposiveness, to approach the highest perfection of an author of 
nature as a perfection which is absolutely necessary, hence cognizable a 
priori? The regulative principle' demands that systematic unity be presupposed 
absolutely as a unity of nature that is recognized not only 
empirically but also a priori, though still indeterminately, and hence as 
following from the essence of things. But if! antecedently make a highest 
ordering being the ground, then the unity of nature will in fact be 
done away with. For then this unity is entirely foreign and contingent 
in relation to the nature of things, and it cannot be cognized from the 
universal laws thereof. Hence arises a vicious circle in one's proof, 
where one presupposes what really ought to have been proved. 


To take the regulative principle! of the systematic unity of nature for 
a constitutive one, and to presuppose hypostatically, as a cause, what is 
only in the idea as a ground for the harmonious use of reason, is only 
to confuse reason. The investigation of nature takes its own course, fol-A694/ B 722 
lowing only the chain of natural causes according to their universal 
laws in conformity to the idea of an author, to be sure, yet not to derive 
from that idea the purposiveness it is seeking everywhere, but

rather in order to cognize its existence from this purposiveness which 
it seeks in the essence of natural things, where possible in the essence 
of all things in general as well, and hence to cognize it as absolutely 
necessary. VV'hether or not this latter may succeed, the idea always remains 
correct, and so does its use, if it has been restricted to the conditions 
of a merely regulative principle. a 

Complete purposive unity is perfection (absolutely considered). If we 
do not find this in the essence of the things which constitute the whole 
object of experience, i.e., all our objectively valid cognition, hence in 
universal and necessary laws of nature, then how will we infer straightaway 
from this to the idea of a highest and absolutely necessary perfection 
in an original being, which is the origin of all causality? The 
greatest systematic unity, consequently also purposive unity, is the 
school and even the ground of the possibility of the greatest use of 
human reason. Hence the idea of it is inseparably bound up with the 


A695/ B 723 essence of our reason. The very same idea, therefore, is legislative for us, 
and thus it is very natural to assume a corresponding legislative reason 
(intelleetus archetypus) from which all systematic unity of nature, as the 
object of our reason, is to be derived. 
In the Antinomy of Pure Reason, we took the opportunity to say that 
all questions that pure reason poses must absolutely be answerable,I27 
and that the excuse of the limits of our cognition, which in many questions 
of nature is as unavoidable as it is proper, cannot be permitted 
here, because here the questions are not laid before us by the nature of 
things but only through the nature of reason, and they are solely about 
its internal arrangement. We can now confirm this assertion, which 
seemed bold at first glance, regarding the two questions in which pure 
reason has its greatest interest, and thereby bring our consideration of 
reason's dialectic to full completion. 
Thus if one asks (in respect of a transcendental theology)* first 

A696/B724 whether there is anything different from the world which contains the 
ground of the world order and its connection according to universal 
laws, then the answer is: Without a doubt. For the world is a sum of 
appearances, and so there has to be some transcendental ground for it, 

A695 /B 723 * What I have said earlier about the psychological idea and its proper vocationb 
as a principle' for the merely regulative use of reason exempts me from any 
particularly lengthy discussion of the transcendental illusion according to 
which that systematic unity of all manifoldness of inner sense is represented 
hypostatically. The procedure here is very similar to the one that the Critique 
observes in regard to the theological ideal.

i.e., a ground thinkable merely by the pure understanding. If the ques


tion is second whether this being is substance, of the greatest reality, 

necessary, etc., then I answer that this question has no significance 

at all. For all the categories through which I attempt to frame a con


cept of such an object are of none but an empirical use, and they have 

no sense at all when they are not applied to objectsa of possible experi


ence, i.e., to the world of sense. Outside this field they are mere titles 

for concepts, which one might allow, but through which one can also 

understand nothing. Finally, if the question is third whether we may 

not at least think this being different from the world in accordance with 

an analogy with objects of experience, then the answer is by all means, 

but only as object in the idea and not in reality, namely, only insofar as A697/B725 

it is a substratum, unknown to us, of the systematic unity, order, and 

purposiveness of the world's arrangement, which reason has to make 

into a regulative principleb of its investigation of nature. Still more, in 

this idea we can allow certain anthropomorphisms, which are expedient 

for the regulative principle we are thinking of, without fear or blame. 

For it is always only an idea, which is by no means related directly to a 

being different from the world, but rather referred to the regulative 

principled of the world's systematic unity, but only by means of a schema 

of that unity, namely of a supreme intelligence that is its author through 

wise intentions. What this original grounde of the world's unity is in it


self ought not to have been thought through this, but rather only how 

we ought to use it, or rather its idea, in relation to the systematic use of 

reason in regard to things in the world. 
But in this way (one will continue to ask) can we nevertheless assume 

a unique wise and all-powerful world author? Without any doubt; and 
not only that, but we must presuppose such a being. But then do we extend 
our cognition beyond the field of possible experience? By no 
means. For we have only presupposed a Something, of which we have 

no concept at all of what it is in itself (a merely transcendental object); A698/ B 726 

but, in relation to the systematic and purposive order of the world's 

structure, which we must presuppose when we study nature, we have 

thought this being, which is unknown to us, in accordance with the 

analogy with an intelligence (an empirical concept); i.e., in regard to 

the ends and the perfection on which those ends are grounded, we have 

given it just those properties that could contain the ground for such a 

systematic unity in accordance with the conditions of our reason. This

idea is therefore grounded entirely respective to the use our reason 
makes of it in the world. But if we wanted to grant it absolute objective 
validity, then we would be forgetting that we are thinking solely of 
a being in the idea; and, since we began with a ground which is not determinable 
at all through considering the world, we would thereby 
place ourselves in no position to apply this principlea suitably to the 
empirical use of reason. 

But (one will ask further) in such a way can I still make use of the 
concept and the presupposition of a highest being in rationally considering 
the world? Yes; that was really why things were grounded on this 
idea of reason. Yet may I regard purpose-likeb orderings as intentions, 

A6991 B 727 by deriving them from the divine will, though of course mediately 
through predispositions toward them set up in the world? Yes, you can 
do that too, but only in such a way that it is all the same to you whether 
someone says that the divine wisdom has ordered everything to its 
supreme ends, or that the idea of the highest wisdom is a regulative one 
in the investigation of nature and a principle of the systematic and 
purposive unity thereof in accordance with universal laws, even where 
we are not aware of it; i.e., where you do perceive purposive unity, it 
must not matter at all whether you say, "God has wisely willed it so" or 
"Nature has wisely so ordered it." For the greatest systematic and purposive 
unity, which your reason demands as a regulative principled to 
ground all investigation of nature, was precisely what justified you in 
making the idea of a highest intelligence the ground as a schema of the 
regulative principle;e and however much purposiveness you encounter 
in the world in accordance with that principle! so much confirmation 
do you have for the rightness of your idea; since, however, the principleg 
you are thinking of has no other aim than to seek out the necessary 
and greatest possible unity of nature, we will have the idea of a 
highest being to thank for this so far as we reach it, but we can never 
get around the universal laws of nature, so as to regard this purposive-

A 7001 B 728 ness of nature as contingent and hyperphysical in its origin, without 
contradicting ourselves, since it was only by taking these laws as our aim 
that things were grounded on the idea; for we were not justified in assuming 
a being above nature with the properties we are thinking of, but 
only in grounding things on the idea of this being in order to regard ap

pearances" as systematically connected to one another in accordance 

with the analogy of a causal determination. 
Just for this reason we are also justified in thinking of the worldcause 
in the idea not only according to a subtle anthropomorphism 
(without which nothing at all could be thought about itb), namely as a 
being that has understanding, liking and disliking, and desire and will 
in conformity with them, etc., but also in ascribing to that being infinite 
perfection far transcending what we could justify on the basis of 
our empirical acquaintance with the world-order. For the regulative 
law of systematic unity would have us study nature as ifsystematic and 
purposive unity together with the greatest possible manifoldness were 
to be encountered everywhere to infinity. For although we may light on 
or reach only a little of this perfection of the world, yet it belongs to 
the legislation of our reason to seek for it and presume it everywhere, 
and it must always be advantageous for us, and can never become disadvantageous, 
to institute our consideration of nature in accordance A 70I I B7 29 
with this principle.c But under this way of representing the idea of a 
highest world-author as a ground, it is clear that I ground things not on 
the existence or acquaintance with this being, but only on its idea; thus 
I really derive nothing from this being, but only from the idea of it, i.e., 
from the nature of the things in the world in accordance with such an 
idea. It also seems to have been a certain, though to be sure undeveloped, 
consciousness of the genuine use of this rational concept of ours 
which occasioned the modest and reasonabled language used by philosophers 
of all ages in talking of the wisdom and providence of nature, 
and of divine wisdom, as if they were expressions with the same 
meaninge-preferring, indeed, the first expression as long as they have 
to do merely with speculative reason, because this restrains us from the 
presumption of making a bigger assertion than we are warranted in 
making, and at the same time points reason back to its proper field, 
which is nature. 

Thus pure reason, which initially seemed to promise us nothing less

principles,a which certainly command greater unity than the empirical 
use of the understanding can reach, but just because they put the goal 

A702/ B 730 we are approaching so far off, they bring this goal to the highest degree 
of agreement with itself through systematic unity; but if one misunderstands 
them and takes them to be constitutive principlesb of transcendent

persuasion and imaginary knowledge, and thus also eternal contradictions 
and controversies.

Thus all human cognition begins with intuitions, goes from there to 
concepts, and ends with ideas. Although in regard to all three elements 
it has sources of cognition a priori which seem at first glance to scorn 
the boundaries of all experience, a completed critique convinces us that 
reason in its speculative use can with these elements never get beyond 
the field of possible experience, and that the proper vocation' of this 
supreme faculty of cognition is to employ all its methods and principles 
only in order to penetrate into the deepest inwardness of natureI28 in 
accordance with all possible principles d of unity, of which the unity of 
ends is the most prominent, but is never to fly across the boundaries 
of nature, outside which there is for us nothing but empty space. Of 
course the critical investigation, in the Transcendental Analytic, of all 
A 703 / B 73 I propositions that can extend our cognition beyond all actual experience 
has sufficiently convinced us that they can never lead to anything mote 
than a possible experience, and if one were not mistrustful of even the 
clearest of abstracte and general doctrines/ and if charming and plausible 
prospects did not lure us to reject the compulsion of these doctrines, 
then of course we might have been able to dispense with our 
painstaking examination of the dialectical witnesses which a transcendent 
reason brings forward on behalf of its pretensions; for we already 
knew beforehand with complete certainty that all their allegations, 
while perhaps honestly meant, had to be absolutely null and void, because 
they dealt with informationg which no human being can ever get. 
Yet because there will never be an end to discussion unless one gets to 
the bottom of the illusion that can fool even the most rational, and also

carry out an exhaustive examination of the vain elaborations of speculative

son as an edifice for which we have in ourselves at least the idea, then I 
can say that in the Transcendental Doctrine of Elements we have made 
an estimate of the building materials and determined for what sort of 
edifice, with what height and strength, they would suffice. It turned out, 
of course, that although we had in mind a tower that would reach the 
heavens, the supply of materials sufficed only for a dwelling that was just 
roomy enough for our business on the plane of experience and high 
enough to survey it; however, that bold undertaking had to fail from lack 
of material, not to mention the confusion of languages that unavoidably 
divided the workers over the plan and dispersed them throughout the 
world, leaving each to build on his own according to his own design.I 
Now we are concerned not so much with the materials as with the plan, 
and, having been warned not to venture some arbitrary and blind project 
that might entirely exceed our entire capacity,b yet not being able to 
abstain from the erection of a sturdy dwelling, we have to aim at an edifice 
in relatione to the supplies given to us that is at the same time suited 

to our needs. 
By the transcendental doctrine of method, therefore, I understand 
the determination of the formal conditions of a complete system of A708/ B 736 
pure reason. With this aim, we shall have to concern ourselves with a 
discipline, a canon, an architectonic, and finally a historyof pure reason,
2 and will accomplish, in a transcendental respect, that which, under 
the name of a practical logic,3 with regard to the use of the understanding 
in general, the schools sought but accomplished only badly; 
for since general logic is not limited to any particular kind of cognition 
of the understanding (e.g., not to the pure cognition of the understanding) 
nor to certain objects, it cannot, without borrowing knowledge 
from other sciences, do more than expound titles for possible 
methods and technical expressions that are used in regard to that which 
is systematic in all sorts of sciences, which first makes the novice familiar 
with names the significance and use of which he will only learn in 
the future.

A708/Bh736 The Transcendental Doctrine of Method 

First Chapter 
The discipline of pure reason 4 
In humanity's general lust for knowledge, negative judgments, which 
are negative not merely on the basis of logical form but also on the basis 
of their content, do not stand in high regard: one regards them as jealous 
enemies of our unremitting drive straining for the expansion of our 

A 709/ B 737 cognition, and it almost takes an apology to earn toleration for them, 
let alone favor and esteem. 
To be sure, logically one can express negatively any propositions that 
one wants, but in regard to the content of our cognition in general, that 
is, whether it is expanded or limited by a judgment, negative judgments 
have the special job solely of preventing error. Hence even negative 
propositions, which are to prevent a false cognition, are often quite true 
yet empty where error is never possible, i.e., not appropriate for their 
purpose, and for this reason are often ridiculous, like the proposition of 
the scholastic orator that Alexander could not have conquered any lands 
without an army. 

But where the limits of our possible cognition are very narrow, where 
the temptation to judge is great, where the illusion that presents itself 
is very deceptive, and where the disadvantage of error is very serious, 
there the negative in instruction, which serves merely to defend us 
from errors, is more important than many a positive teaching by means 
of which our cognition could be augmented. The compulsion through 
which the constant propensity to stray from certain rules is limited and 
finally eradicated is called discipline. It is different from culture, 
which would merely produce a skill without first canceling out another 
one that is already present. In the formation of a talent, therefore, 
A7IO/B738 which already has by itself a tendency to expression, discipline will 
make a negative contribution,* but culture and doctrine a positive one.

The discipline of pure reason 

Everyone will readily grant that the temperament as well as the talents 
that would allow a free and unlimited movement (such as imagination 
and wit) require discipline in many respects. But that reason, which 
is properly obliged to prescribe its discipline for all other endeavors, 
should have need of one itself, may certainly seem strange, and in fact 
reason has previously escaped such a humiliation only because, given 
the pomp and the serious mien with which it appears, no one could easily 
come to suspect it of frivolously playing with fancies instead of concepts 
and words instead of things. 

No critique of reason in empirical use was needed, since its principles 
were subjected to a continuous examination on the touchstone of expe-A 711/ B 739 
rience; it was likewise unnecessary in mathematics, whose concepts 
must immediately be exhibited in concreto in pure intuition, through 
which anything unfounded and arbitrary instantly becomes obvious. 
But where neither empirical nor pure intuition keeps reason in a visible 
track, namely in its transcendental use in accordance with mere concepts, 
there it so badly needs a discipline to constrain its propensity to 
expansion beyond the narrow boundaries of possible experience and to 
preserve it from straying and error that the entire philosophy of pure 
reason is concerned merely with this negative use. Individual errors can 
be remedied through censure and their causes through critique. But 
where, as in pure reason, an entire system of delusions and deceptions 
is encountered, which are connected with each other and unified under 
common principles,a there a quite special and indeed negative legislation 
seems to be required, which under the name of a discipline erects, 
as it were, a system of caution and self-examination out of the nature of 
reason and the objects of its pure use, before which no false sophistical 
illusion can stand up but must rather immediately betray itself, regardless 
of all grounds for being spared. 

But it is well to note that in this second main part of the transcen-A 712 / B 740 
dental critique I do not direct the discipline of pure reason to the content 
but rather only to the method of cognition from pure reason. The 
former has already taken place in the Doctrine of Elements. But there 
is so much that is similar in the use of reason, whatever object it may be 

other cases where the first expression, as correction/ must carefully be contrasted 
to teaching,' and the nature of things itself also makes it necessary to 
preserve the only suitable expression for this difference, that I wish that this 
word would never be allowed to be used in anything but the negative sense.

applied to, and yet, insofar as it would be transcendental, it is so essentially 
different from all other uses, that without the admonitory negative 
doctrine of a discipline especially aimed at them the errors could 
not be avoided that must necessarily arise from the inappropriate pursuit 
of such methods, which might be suitable for reason elsewhere but 
not here.

The discipline of pure reasonin dogmatic use. 


Mathematics gives the most resplendent example of pure reason happily 
expanding itself without assistance from experience. Examples are 
contagious, especially for the same faculty, which naturally flatters itself 
that it will have the same good fortune in other cases that ithas had in 
one. Hence pure reason hopes to be able to expand itself in as happy 

A7I3/B741 and well grounded a way in its transcendental use as it succeeded in 
doing in its mathematical use, by applying the same method in the former 
case that was of such evident utility in the latter. It is therefore very 
important for us to know whether the method for obtaining apodictic 
certainty that one calls mathematical in the latter science is identical 
with that by means of which one seeks the same certainty in philosophy, 
and that would there have to be called dogmatic. 
Philosophical cognition is rational cognition from concepts, 
mathematical cognition that from the construction of concepts.5 But 
to construct a concept means to exhibit a priori the intuition corresponding 
to it. For the construction of a concept, therefore, a nonempirical 
intuition is required, which consequently, as intuition, is an 
individual object,a but that must nevertheless, as the construction of a 
concept (of a general representation), express in the representation universal 
validity for all possible intuitions that belong under the same 
concept. Thus I construct a triangle by exhibiting an object corresponding 
to this concept, either through mere imagination, in pure intuition, 
or on paper, in empirical intuition, but in both cases completely 
a priori, without having had to borrow the pattern for it from any expe-


A714/ B 742 rience. The individual drawn figure is empirical, and nevertheless 
serves to express the concept without damage to its universality, for in 
the case of this empirical intuition we have taken account only of the action 
of constructing the concept, to which many determinations, e.g., 
those of the magnitude of the sides and the angles, are entirely indifferent, 
and thus we have abstracted from these differences, which do 
not alter the concept of the triangle. 

a Object 

630 



The discipline of pure reason in dogmatic use 

Philosophical cognition thus considers the particular only in the universal, 
but mathematical cognition considers the universal in the particular, 
indeed even in the individual, yet nonetheless a priori and by 
means of reason, so that just as this individual is determined under certain 
general conditions of construction, the object of the concept, to 
which this individual corresponds only as its schema, must likewise be 
thought as universally determined. 

The essential difference between these two kinds of rational cognition 
therefore consists in this form, and does not rest on the difference 
in their matter, or objects. Those who thought to distinguish philosophy 
from mathematics by saying of the former that it has merely quality 
while the latter has quantity as its object a have taken the effect for 
the cause. The form of mathematical cognition is the cause of its pertaining 
solely to quanta. For only the concept of magnitudes can be 
constructed, i.e., exhibited a priori in intuition, while qualities cannot be 
exhibited in anything but empirical intuition. Hence a rational cog-A7IS/B743 
nition of them can be possible only through concepts. Thus no one 
can ever derive an intuition corresponding to the concept of reality 
from anywhere except experience, and can never partake of it a priori 
from oneself and prior to empirical consciousness. The shape of a cone 
can be made intuitive without any empirical assistance, merely in accordance 
with the concept, but the color of this cone must first be given 
in one experience or another. I cannot exhibit the concept of a cause in 
general in intuition in any way except in an example given to me byhexperience, 
etc. Now philosophy as well as mathematics does deal with 
magnitudes, e.g., with totality, infinity, etc. And mathematics also occupies 
itself with the difference between lines and planes as spaces with 
different quality, and with the continuity of extension as a quality of it. 
But although in such cases they have a common object, the manner of 
dealing with it through reason is entirely different in philosophical than 
in mathematical consideration. The former confines itself solely to general 
concepts, the latter cannot do anything with the mere concepts but 
hurries immediately to intuition, in which it considers the concept in 
concreto, although not empirically, but rather solely as one which it has 
exhibited a priori, i.e., constructed, and in which that which follows A7I6/B744 
from the general conditions of the construction must also hold generally 
of the objecrl' of the constructed concept. 


Give a philosopher the concept of a triangle, and let him try to find 
out in his way how the sum of its angles might be related to a right 
angle. He has nothing but the concept of a figure enclosed by three 
straight lines, and in it the concept of equally many angles. Now he may

reflect on this concept as long as he wants, yet he will never produce 
anything new. He can analyze and make distinct the concept of a 
straight line, or of an angle, or of the number three, but he will not 
come upon any other properties that do not already lie in these concepts. 
But now let the geometer take up this question. He begins at 
once to construct a triangle. Since he knows that two right angles together 
are exactly equal to all of the adjacent angles that can be drawn 
at one point on a straight line, he extends one side of his triangle, and 
obtains two adjacent angles that together are equal to two right ones. 
Now he divides the external one of these angles by drawing a line parallel 
to the opposite side of the triangle, and sees that here there arises 
an external adjacent angle which is equal to an internal one, etc.6 In 

A 71 7 / B 745 such a way, through a chain of inferences that is always guided by intuition, 
he arrives at a fully illuminating and at the same time general solution 
of the question. 
But mathematics does not merely construct magnitudes (quanta), as 
in geometry, but also mere magnitude (quantitatem), as in algebra,a 
where it entirely abstracts from the constitution of the object that is to 
be thought in accordance with such a concept of magnitude.7 In this 
case it chooses a certain notation for all construction of magnitudes in 
general (numbers), as well as addition, subtraction, extraction of roots, 
etc./ and, after it has also designated the general concept of quantities 
in accordance with their different relations,' it then exhibits all the procedures 
through which magnitude is generated and altered in accordance 
with certain rules in intuition; where one magnitude is to be 
divided by another, it places their symbols together in accordance with 
the form of notation for division, and thereby achieves by a symbolic 
construction equally well what geometry does by an ostensive or geometrical 
construction (of the objects themselves), which discursive cognition 
could never achieve by means of mere concepts. 
"What might be the cause of the very different situations in which 
these two reasoners find themselves, one of whom makes his way in accordance 
with concepts, the other in accordance with intuitions that 

A 718/B 746 he exhibits a priori for the concepts? According to the transcendental 
fundamental doctrine expounded above, this cause is clear. At issue 
here are not analytic propositions, which can be generated through 
mere analysis of concepts (here the philosopher would without doubt 
have the advantage over his rival), but synthetic ones, and indeed ones 
that are to be cognized a priori. For I am not to see what I actually think

in my concept of a triangle (this is nothing further than its mere definition), 
rather I am to go beyond it to properties that do not lie in this 
concept but still belong to it. Now this is not possible in any way but 
by determining my object in accordance with the conditions of either 
empirical or pure intuition. The former would yield only an empirical 
proposition (through measurement of its angles), which would contain 
no universality, let alone necessity, and propositions of this sort are not 
under discussion here. The second procedure, however, is that of 
mathematical and here indeed of geometrical construction, by means 
of which I put together in a pure intuition, just as in an empirical one, 
the manifold that belongs to the schema of a triangle in general and 
thus to its concept, through which general synthetic propositions must 
be constructed.a 

In vain, therefore, would I reflect on the triangle philosophically, i.e., 
discursively, without thereby getting any further than the mere defini-A719/B747 
tion with which, however, I had to begin. There is, to be sure, a transcendental 
synthesis from concepts alone, with which in turn only the 
philosopher can succeed, but which never concerns more than a thing 
in general, with regard to the conditions under which its perception 
could belong to possible experience. But in mathematical problems the 
question is not about this nor about existenceb as such at all, but about 
the properties of the objects in themselves, solely insofar as these are 
combined with the concept of them. 

In these examples we have only attempted to make distinct what a 
great difference there is between the discursive use of reason in accordance 
with concepts and its intuitive use through the construction of 
concepts. Now the question naturally arises, what is the cause that 
makes such a twofold use of reason necessary, and by means of which 
conditions can one knowc whether only the first or also the second takes 
place? 

All of our cognition is in the end related to possible intuitions: for 
through these alone is an object given. Now an a priori concept (a nonempirical 
concept) either already contains a pure intuition in itself, in 
which case it can be constructed; or else it contains nothing but the synthesis 
of possible intuitions, which are not given a priori, in which case 
one can well judge synthetically and a priori by its means, but only dis-A 720/ B 748 
cursively, in accordance with concepts, andd never intuitively through 
the construction of the concept. 

Now of all intuition none is given a priori except the mere form of ap

pearances, space and time, and a concept of these, as quanta, can be exhibited 
a priori in pure intuition, i.e., constructed, together with either 
its quality (its shape) or else merely its quantity (the mere synthesis of 
the homogeneous manifold) through number. The matter of appearances, 
however, through which things in space and time are given to us, 
can be represented only in perception, thus a posteriori. The only concept 
that represents this empirical content of appearances a priori is 
the concept of the thing in general, and the synthetic a priori cognition 
of this can never yield a priori more than the mere rule of the synthesis 
ofthat which perception may give a posteriori, but never the intuition of 
the real object, since this must necessarily be empirical. 


Synthetic propositions that pertain to things in general, the intuition 
of which cannot be given a priori, are transcendental. Thus transcendental 
propositions can never be given through construction of concepts, 
but only in accordance with a priori concepts. They contain 

merely the rule in accordance with which a certain synthetic unity of 

A72IiB749 that which cannot be intuitively represented a priori (of perceptions) 
should be sought empirically. They cannot, however, exhibit a single 
one of their concepts a priori in any case, but do this only a posteriori, by 
means of experience, which first becomes possible in accordance with 
those synthetic principles. 
If one is to judge synthetically about a concept, then one must go beyond 
this concept, and indeed go to the intuition in which it is given. For 
if one were to remain with that which is contained in the concept, then 
the judgment would be merely analytic, an explanation of what is actually 
contained in the thought. However, I can go from the concept to the 
pure or empirical intuition corresponding to it in order to assess it in concreto 
and cognize a priori or a posteriori what pertains to its object. The 
former is rational and mathematical cognition through the construction 
of the concept, the latter merely empirical (mechanical) cognition, 
which can never yield necessary and apodictic propositions. Thus I could 
analyze my empirical concept of gold without thereby gaining anything 
more than being able to enumerate what I actually think by means of this 
word, which would certainly produce a logical improvement in my cognition, 
but no augmentation or supplementation of it. But I can take the 
matter that goes by this name and initiate perceptions of it, which will 

A72z1B 750 provide me with various synthetic though empirical propositions. The 
mathematical concept of a triangle I would construct, i.e., give in intuition 
a priori, and in this way I would acquire synthetic but rational cognition. 
However, if I am given the transcendental concept of a reality, 
substance, force, etc., it designates neither an empirical nor a pure intuition, 
but only the synthesis of empirical intuitions (which thus qnnot 
be given a priori), and since the synthesis cannot proceed a priori to the 
intuition that corresponds to it, no determining synthetic proposition 

634 



The discipline of pure reason in dogmatic use 

but only a principle of the synthesis* of possible empirical intuitions can 
arise from it. A transcendental proposition is therefore a synthetic rational 
cognition in accordance with mere concepts, and thus discursive, 
since through it all synthetic unity of empirical cognition first becomes 

possible, but no intuition is given by it a priori. 
There are thus two uses of reason, which, regardless of the univer-A 72 3 / B 75] 
sality of cognition and its a priori generation, which they have in common, 
are nevertheless very different in procedure, precisely because 
there are two components to the appearance through which all objects 
are given to us: the form of intuition (space and time), which can be 
cognized and determined completely a priori, and the matter (the physical), 
or the content, which signifies a something that is encountered in 
space and time, and which thus contains an existence and corresponds 
to sensation. With regard to the latter, which can never be given in a 
determinate manner except empirically, we can have nothing a priori except 
indeterminate concepts of the synthesis of possible sensations insofar 
as they belong to the unity of apperception (in a possible 
experience). With regard to the former we can determine our concepts 
a priori in intuition, for we create the objects themselves in space and 
time through homogeneouso synthesis, considering them merely as 
quanta. The former is called the use of reason in accordance with concepts, 
because we can do nothing further than bring appearances under 
concepts, according to their real content, which cannot be determined 
except empirically, i.e., a posteriori (though in accord with those concepts 
as rules of an empirical synthesis); the latter is the use of reason 
through construction of concepts, because these concepts, since they al-A724/B752 
ready apply to an a priori intuition, for that very reason can be determinately 
given in pure intuition a priori and without any empirical data. To 
decide about everything that exists (a thing in space or time) whether 
and how far it is or is not a quantum, whether existence or the lack 
thereof must be represented in it, how far this something (which fills 
space or time) is a primary substratum or mere determination, whether 
it has a relation of its existence to something else as cause or effect, and 

* By means of the concept of cause I actually go beyond the empirical concept A72 2 / B 750 
of an occurrence (that something happens), but not to the intuition that exhibits 
the concept of cause in concreto, rather to the time-conditions in general 
that may be found to be in accord with the concept of cause in experience. I 
therefore proceed merely in accordance with concepts, and cannot proceed 
through construction of concepts, since the concept is a rule of the synthesis 
of perceptions, which are not pure intuitions and which therefore cannot be 
givena priori.

finally whether with regard to its existence it is isolated or in reciprocal 
dependence with others; to decide about the possibility, actuality, and 
necessity of its existence or the opposites thereof: all of this belongs to 
rational cognition from concepts, which is called philosophical. But 
to determine an intuition a priori in space (shape), to divide time (duration), 
or merely to cognize the universal in the synthesis of one and the 
same thing in time and space and the magnitude of an intuition in general 
(number) which arises from that: that is a concern of reason 
through construction of the concepts, and is called mathematical. 

The great good fortune that reason enjoys by means of mathematics 
leads entirely naturally to the expectation that, if not mathematics itself, 
then at least its method will also succeed outside of the field of magni


A725/B753 tudes, since it brings all of its concepts to intuitions that it can give a 
priori and by means of which, so to speak, it becomes master over nature; 
while pure philosophy, on the contrary, fumbles around in nature 
with discursive a priori concepts without being able to make their reality 
intuitive a priori and by that means confirm it. Further, the masters 
of this art do not seem to lack any confidence in themselves, nor does 
the public seem to lack any great expectations of their talents, should 
they ever concern themselves about this at all. For since they have 
hardly ever philosophized about mathematics (a difficult business!), 
they have never given a thought to the specific difference between the 
two uses of reason. Rules used customarily and empirically, which they 
have borrowed from common reason, count as axioms with them. From 
whence the concepts of space and time with which they busy themselves 
(as the only original quanta) might be derived, they have never concerned 
themselves, and likewise it seems to them to be useless to investigate 
the origin of pure concepts of the understanding and the scope of 
their validity; rather, they merely use them. In all of this they proceed 
quite correctly, as long as they do not overstep their appointed boundaries, 
namely those of nature. But they slip unnoticed from the field of 
sensibility to the insecure territory of pure and even transcendental 
concepts, where they are allowed the ground neither to stand nor swim

The discipline of pure reason in dogmatic use 

Since we have made it our duty to determine the bounds of pure reason 
in transcendental use exactly and with certainty, but this sort of endeavor 
has the peculiarity that, in spite of the most pressing and clearest 
warnings, it still always lets itself hope that it can stave off having to give 
up entirely the effort to get beyond the bounds of experience into the 
charming regions of the intellectual, it is therefore necessary to cut 
away, as it were, the last anchor of a fantastical hope, and to show that 
the pursuit of the mathematical method in this sort of cognition cannot 
offer the least advantage, unless it is that of revealing its own nakedness 
all the more distinctly, and revealing that mathematicsO and philosophy 
are two entirely different things, although they offer each other their 
hand in natural science, thus that the procedure of the one can never be 
imitated by that of the other. 

Mathematics is thoroughly grounded on definitions, axioms, and 
demonstrations. I will content myself with showing that none of these 
elements, in the sense in which the mathematician takes them, can be 
achieved or imitated by philosophyjb and that by means of his method A727/B755 
the mathematician can build nothing in philosophy except houses of 
cards, while by means of his method the philosopher can produce nothing 
in mathematics but idle chatter, while philosophy consists precisely 
in knowing its bounds, and even the mathematician, if his talent is not 
already bounded by nature and limited to his specialty, can neither reject 
its warnings nor disregard them. 

I. On definitions.c,s As the expression itself reveals, to define properly 
means just to exhibit originallyd the exhaustive concept of a thing 
within its boundaries.* Given such a requirement, an empirical concept 
cannot be defined at all but only explicated. For since we have in 
it only some marks of a certain kind of objects of the senses, it is never 
certain whether by means of the word that designates the same object 
* Exhaustivenesssignifies the clarity and sufficiency of marks; boundaries, the 
precision, that is, that there are no more of these than are required for the exhaustive 
concept; original, however, that this boundary-determination is not 
derived from anywhere else and thus in need of a proof, which would make 
the supposed definition' incapable of standing at the head of all judgments 
about an object.

one does not sometimes think more of these marks but another time 

A728/B 756 fewer of them. Thus in the concept of gold one person might think, besides 
its weight, color, and ductility, its property of not rusting, while 
another might know nothing about this. One makes use of certain 
marks only as long as they are sufficient for making distinctions; new 
observations, however, take some away and add some, and therefore the 
concept never remains within secure boundaries. And in any case what 
would be the point of defining such a concept? -since when, e.g., water 
and its properties are under discussion, one will not stop at what is intended 
by the word "water" but rather advance to experiments, and the 
word, with the few marks that are attached to it, is to constitute only a 
designation and not a concept of the thing; thus the putative definition 
is nothing other than the determination of the word. Second, strictly 
speaking no concept given a priori can be defined, e.g., substance, cause, 
right, equity, etc. For I can never be certain that the distinct representation 
of a (still confused) given concept has been exhaustively developed 
unless I know that it is adequate to the object. But since the 
concept of the latter, as it is given, can contain many obscure representations, 
which we pass by in our analysis though we always use them in 
application, the exhaustiveness of the analysis of my concept is always 

A729/B757 doubtful, and by many appropriate examples can only be made probably 
but never apodictically certain. Instead of the expression "definition" 
I would rather use that of exposition,a which is always cautious, 
and which the critic can accept as valid to a certain degree while yet retaining 
reservations about its exhaustiveness. Since therefore neither 
empirical concepts nor concepts given a priori can be defined, there remain 
none but arbitrarily thought ones for which one can attempt this 
trick. In such a case I can always define my concept: for I must know 
what I wanted to think, since I deliberately made it up, and it was not 
given to me either through the nature of the understanding or through 
experience; but I cannot say that I have thereby defined a true object.9 
For if the concept depends upon empirical conditions, e.g., a chronometer,
b,IO then the object and its possibility are not given through this 
arbitrary concept; from the concept I do not even know whether it has 
an object, and my explanationc could better be called a declaration (of 
my project) than a definition of an object. Thus there remain no other 
concepts that are fit for being defined than those containing an arbitrary 
synthesis which can be constructed a priori, and thus only mathematics 
has definitions. For the object that it thinks it also exhibits a 

A 730/ B 758 priori in intuition, and this can surely contain neither more nor less than

the concept, since through the explanationa of the concept the object 
is originally given, i.e., without the explanation being derived from 
anywhere else. The German language has for the expressions exposition, 
explication, declaration and definition b nothing more than the 
one word "explanation,"c,II and hence we must somewhat weaken the 
stringency of the requirement by which we denied philosophical explanations 
the honorary title of "definition," and limit this entire remark 
to this, that philosophical definitions come about only as expositions of 
given concepts, but mathematical ones as constructions of concepts 
that are originally made, thus the former come about only analytically 
through analysis (the completeness of which is never apodictically 
certain), while the latter come about synthetically, and therefore 
make the concept itself, while the former only explain it. From this it 
follows: 

a) That in philosophy one must not imitate mathematics in putting 
the definitions first, unless perhaps as a mere experiment. For since they 
are analyses of given concepts, these concepts, though perhaps only still 
confused, come first, and the incomplete exposition precedes the complete 
one, so that we can often infer much from some marks that we 
have drawn from an as yet uncompleted analysis before we have arrived 
at a complete exposition, i.e., at a definition; in a word, it follows that 
in philosophy the definition, as distinctness made precise, must con-A 731 / B 759 
elude rather than begin the work. * On the contrary, in mathematics we 
do not have any concept at all prior to the definitions, as that through 
which the concept is first given; it therefore must and also always can 
begin with them. 
b) Mathematical definitions can never err. For since the concept is 
first given through the definition, it contains just that which the de fin* 
Philosophy is swarming with mistaken definitions, especially those that actually 
contain elements for definition but are not yet complete. If one would not 
know what to do with a concept until one had defined it, then all philosophizing 
would be in a bad way. But since, however far the elements (of the 
analysis) reach, a good and secure use can always be made of them, even imperfect 
definitions, i.e., propositions that are not really definitions but are true 
and thus approximations to them, can be used with great advantage. In mathematics 
definitions belong ad esse, d in philosophy ad melius esse. e Attaining them

ition would think through it. However, although nothing incorrect can 
occur in its content, nevertheless sometimes, though to be sure only 
rarely, there can be a defect in the form (of its dress), namely with regard 
to precision. Thus the common explanation of the circle, that it is 
a curved line every point of which is the same distance from a single 

A732/B760 one (the center-point), contains the error of unnecessarily introducing 
the determination curved. For it must be a particular theorem, which 
can be deduced from the definition and easily proved, that every line 
each point of which is equally distant from a single one is curved (no 
part of it is straight). Analytical definitions, on the contrary, can err in 
many ways, either by bringing in marks that really do not lie in the concept 
or by lacking the exhaustiveness that constitutes what is essential 
in definitions, since one cannot be so entirely certain of the completeness 
of their analysis. For this reason the mathematical method of definition 
cannot be imitated in philosophy. 

2. On axioms. These are synthetic a priori principles, insofar as they 
are immediately certain. Now one concept cannot be synthetically yet 
immediately combined with another, since for us to be able to go beyond 
a concept a third, mediating cognition is necessary. Now since 
philosophy is merely rational cognition in accordance with concepts, no 
principle is to be encountered in it that deserves the name of an axiom. 
Mathematics, on the contrary, is capable of axioms, e.g., that three 
B 76I points always lie in a plane, because by means of the construction of 
concepts in the intuition of the object it can connect the predicates of 
the latter a priori and immediately. A synthetic principle, on the con-

A 73 3 trary, e.g., the proposition that everything that happens has its cause, 
can never be immediately certain from mere concepts, because I must 
always look around for some third thing, namely the condition of timedetermination 
in an experience, and could never directly cognize such 
a principle immediately from concepts alone. Discursive principles are 
therefore something entirely different from intuitive ones, i.e., axioms. 
The former always require a deduction, with which the latter can entirely 
dispense, and, since the latter are on the same account selfevident, 
which the philosophical principles, for all their certainty, can 
never pretend to be, any synthetic proposition of pure and transcendental 
reason is infinitely less obvious (as is stubbornly said) than the 
proposition that Two times two is four. To be sure, in the Analytic, in 
the table of the principles of pure understanding, I have also thought of 
certain axioms of intuition; but the principle that was introduced there 
was not itself an axiom, but only served to provide the principle a of the 
possibility of axioms in general, and was itself only a principle from 
concepts. For even the possibility of mathematics must be shown in 

a 

Principium 

640 



The discipline of pure reason in dogmatic use 

transcendental philosophy. Philosophy thus has no axioms and can 
never simply offer its a priori principles as such, but must content itself A734/B 762 
with justifying their authority through a thorough deduction. 

3. On demonstrations.a Only an apodictic proof, insofar as it is intuitive, 
can be called a demonstration. Experience may well teach us 
what is, but not that it could not be otherwise. Hence empirical grounds 
of proof cannot yield apodictic proof. From a priori concepts (in discursive 
cognition), however, intuitive certainty, i.e., self-evidence,b can 
never arise, however apodictically certain the judgment may otherwise 
be. Thus only mathematics contains demonstrations, since it does not 
derive its cognition from concepts, but from their construction, i.e., 
from the intuition that can be given a priori corresponding to the concepts. 
Even the way algebraists proceed with their equations, from 
which by means of reduction they bring forth the truth together with 
the proof, is not a geometrical construction, but it is still a characteristic 
construction,12 in which one displays by signs in intuition the concepts, 
especially of relationsc of quantities, and, without even regarding 
the heuristic, secures all inferences against mistakes by placing each of 
them before one's eyes. Philosophical cognition, on the contrary, must 
do without this advantage, since it must always consider the universal in 
abstracto (through concepts), while mathematics can assess the universal 
in concreto (in the individual intuition) and yet through pure a priori A735 /B 763 
intuition, where every false step becomes visible. Since they can only be 
conducted by means of mere words (the object in thought), I would 
therefore prefer to call the former acroamatic (discursive) proofs rather 
than demonstrations, which, as the expression already indicates, proceed 
through the intuition of the object. 
Now from all of this it follows that it is not suited to the nature of 
philosophy, especially in the field of pure reason, to strut about with a 
dogmatic gait and to decorate itself with the titles and ribbons of mathematics, 
to whose ranks philosophy does not belong, although it has 
every cause to hope for a sisterly union with it. These are idle pretensions 
that can never succeed, but that instead countermand its aim 
of revealing the deceptions of a reason that misjudges its own boundaries 
and of bringing the self-conceit of speculation back to modest but 
thorough self-knowledged by means of a sufficient illumination of our 
concepts. In its transcendental efforts, therefore, reason cannot look 
ahead so confidently, as if the path on which it has traveled leads quite 
directly to the goal, and it must not count so boldly on the premises 

a Demonstrationen 
b Evidenz 
[ Verhdlnisse

641 

Doctrine of Method. Ch. 1. Sec. I 

that ground it as if it were unnecessary for it frequently to look back 
and consider whether there might not be errors in the progress of its in


A736/B 764 ferences to be discovered that were overlooked in its principles" and 
that make it necessary either to determine them further or else to alter 
them entirely. 
I divide all apodictic propositions (whether they are demonstrable or 
immediately certain) into dogmata and mathemata. A direct synthetic 
proposition from concepts is a dogma; such a proposition through construction 
of concepts, on the contrary, is a mathema. Analytic judgments 
do not really teach us anything moreb about the object than what 
the concept that we have of it already contains in itself, since they do 
not expand cognition beyond the concept of the subject, but only elucidate 
this concept. They cannot therefore properly be called dogmas 
(a word which one could perhaps translate as theorems).c But in accordance 
with ordinary usage, of the two types of synthetic a priori 
propositions only those belonging to philosophical cognition carry this 
name, and one would hardly call the propositions of arithmetic or 
geometry "dogmata." This usage thus confirms the explanation we have 
given that only judgments from concepts, and not those from the construction 
of concepts, can be called dogmatic. 
Now all of pure reason in its merely speculative use contains not a 
single direct synthetic judgment from concepts. For through ideas, as 
we have shown, it is not capable of any synthetic judgments that would 
have objective validity; through concepts of the understanding, how-

A 737/ B 765 ever, it certainly erects secure principles, but not directly from concepts, 
but rather always only indirectly through the relation of these 
concepts to something entirely contingent, namely possible experience; 
since if this (something as object of possible experience) is presupposed, 
then they are of course apodictically certain, but in themselves 
they cannot even be cognized a priori (directly) at all. Thus no 
one can have fundamental insight into the proposition "Everything that 
happens has its cause" from these given concepts alone. Hence it is not 
a dogma, although from another point of view, namely that of the sole 
field of its possible use, i.e., experience, it can very well be proved apodictically. 
But although it must be proved, it is called a principle and 
not a theoremd because it has the special property that it first makes 
possible its ground of proof, namely experience, and must always be 
presupposed in this.

no dogmata at all, then any dogmatic method, whether it is borrowed 
from the mathematicians or is of some special kind, is inappropriate per 
se. For it merely masks mistakes and errors, and deceives philosophy, 
the proper aim of which is to allow all of the steps of reason to be seen 

in the clearest light. Nevertheless, the method can always be systematic. 
For our reason itself (subjectively) is a system, but in its pure use, A 738/ B 766 

by means of mere concepts, only a system for research in accordance 

with principles of unity, for which experience alone can give the mat


ter. Of the special method of a transcendental philosophy, however, 

nothing can here be said, since we are concerned only with a critique of 

the circumstances of our faculty -whether we can build at all, and how 

high we can carry our building with the materials that we have (the pure 

a priori concepts). 


First Chapter 
Second Section 
The discipline of pure reason 
with regard to its polemical use. 

Reason must subject itself to critique in all its undertakings, and cannot 
restrict the freedom of critique through any prohibition without damaging 
itself and drawing upon itself a disadvantageous suspicion. Now 
there is nothing so important because of its utility, nothing so holy, that 
it may be exempted from this searching review and inspection, which 
knows no respect for persons. The very existencea of reason depends 
upon this freedom, which has no dictatorial authority, but whose claim 
is never anything more than the agreement of free citizens, each of 
whom must be able to express his reservations, indeed even his veto, A 739/ B 767 
without holding back. 

But now although reason can never refuse critique, it does not always 
have cause to shrink from it. Pure reason in its dogmatic (not 
mathematical) use is not, however, so conscious of the most exact observation 
of its supreme laws that it can appear before the critical eye of 
a higher and judicial reason except with modesty, indeed with a complete 
renunciation of all pretensions to dogmatic authority. 

But it is quite different if it does not have to deal with the censure of 
a judge, but with the claims of its fellow citizens, against which it has 
merely to defend itself. For since the latter would be just as dogmatic, 
though in denial, as reason would be in its affirmation, there can be a 
justification xm;' <'iv8go)Jtov,b which secures it against all interference 
and provides it with a title to its possession that need shrink from no 

a Existenz 
b ad hominem (i.e., according to the person) 


643 


Doctrine of Method. Ch. I. Sec. II 

foreign pretensions, even though it cannot itself be sufficiently proved 

xm:' aA􀂹8ELav.a 

Now by the polemical use of pure reason I understand the defense of 
its propositions against dogmatic denials of them. Here the issue is not 
whether its own assertions might perhaps also be false, but only that no 

A740/B768 one can ever assert the opposite with apodictic certainty (or even only 
with greater plausibility). For in this case we do not hold our possession 
merely by sufferance if we have a title to it, even if not a sufficient one, 
and it is completely certain that no one can ever prove the unlawfulness 
of this possession. 
It is worrisome and depressing that there should be an antithetic of 
pure reason at all, and that pure reason, though it represents the 
supreme court of justice for all disputes, should still come into conflict 
with itself. We had such an apparent antithetic of reason before us 
above, '3 to be sure, but it turned out that it rested on a misunderstanding, 
namely that of taking, in accord with common prejudice, appearances 
for things in themselves, and then demanding an absolute 
completeness in their synthesis, in one or another way (which were 
both equally impossible), which could hardly be expected in the case of 
appearances. There was thus in that case no real contradiction of reason 
with itself in the propositions "The series of appearances given in 
themselves has an absolutely first beginning" and "This series is absolutely 
and in itself without any beginning"; for both propositions are 
quite compatible, since appearances, as regards their existence (as appearances) 
in themselves are nothing at all, i.e., something contradictory, 
and thus their presupposition must naturally be followed by 
contradictory consequences. 

A741/ B 769 However, such a misunderstanding cannot be alleged and the conflict 
of reason thereby set aside if, say, it is asserted theistically There is a 
highest being and asserted atheistically, on the contrary, There is no 
highest being, or when it is asserted, in psychology, "Everything that 
thinks is of absolutely persistent unity and therefore distinct from all 
transitory material unity," against which someone else asserts, "The 
soul is not an immaterial unity and cannot be exempted from all transitoriness." 
For the object of the question is here free of anything foreign 
that contradicts its nature, and the understanding is concerned only 
with things in themselves and not with appearances. There would 
thus certainly be a genuine conflict here, if only pure reason had anything 
to say on the negative side that would approximate the ground for 
an assertion; for as far as the critique of the grounds of proof of the dogmatic 
affirmations is concerned, one can very well concede it without 

a according to the truth 

644 



The discipline of pure reason in polemical use 

thereby giving up these propositions, which still have at least the interest 
of reason in their behalf, to which the opponent cannot appeal at all. 

I am not, to be sure, of the opinion that excellent and thoughtful men 
(e.g., Sulzer),14 aware of the weakness of previous proofs, have so often 
expressed, that one can still hope someday to find self-evident demonstrations 
of the two cardinal propositions of our pure reason: there is a 
God, and there is a future life. Rather, I am certain that this will never A 742/ B 770 
happen. For whence will reason derive the ground for such synthetic assertions, 
which are not related to objects of experience and their inner 
possibility? But it is also apodictically certain that no human being will 
ever step forward who could assert the opposite with the least plausibility, 
let alone assert it dogmatically. For since he could only establish 
this through pure reason, he would have to undertake to prove that a 
highest being or the thinking subject in us as pure intelligence is impossible. 
But whence will he derive the knowledge that would justify 
him in judging synthetically about things beyond all possible experience? 
We can therefore be entirely unconcerned that somebody will 
someday prove the opposite; we therefore do not have to think up 
scholastic proofs, but can always assume these propositions, which are 
quite consistent with the speculative interest of our reason in its empirical 
use and are, moreover, the only means for uniting this with the 
practical interest. For the opponent (who cannot here be considered a 
mere critic) we have our non liqueta ready, which must unfailingly confound 
him, while we do not need to refute his retort, for we always have 
in reserve the subjective maxims of reason, which he necessarily lacks, A743/B771 
and under their protection we can regard all his shadow-boxing with 
tranquility and indifference. 


Thus there is properly no antithetic of pure reason at all. For the only 
battleground for it would have to be sought in the field of pure theology 
and psychology; but this ground will bear no warrior in full armor 
and equipped with weapons that are to be feared. He can only step forward 
with ridicule and boasting, which can be laughed at like child's 
play. This is a comforting remark, which gives reason courage again; for 
on what else could it rely, if it, which is called to do away with all errors, 
were itself ruined, without any hope for peace and tranquil possession? 

Everything that nature itself arranges is good for some aim. Even 
poisons serve to overpower other poisons which are generated in our 
own humors,b and therefore may not be omitted from a complete collection 
of cures (medicines). The objections against the suasions and 
the self-conceit of our purely speculative reason are themselves put 

a 

I.e., the verdict "not proved."

forth by the nature of this reason, and they must therefore have their 
good vocationO and aim, which one must not cast to the wind. Why has 
providence set many objects, although they are intimately connected 

A 744/ B 772 with our highest interest, so high that it is barely granted to us to encounter 
them in an indistinct perception, doubted even by ourselves, 
through which our searching glance is more enticed than satisfied? 
Whether it is useful to venture determinate answers with regard to such 
views is at least doubtful, and perhaps even dangerous. But it is always 
and without any doubt useful to grant reason full freedom in its search 
as well as its examination, so that it can take care of its own interest 
without hindrance, which is promoted just as much by setting limits to 
its insights as by expanding them, and which always suffers if foreign 
hands intervene to lead it forcibly to aims contrary to its natural path. 
Thus let your opponent speak only reason, and fight him solely with 
weapons of reason. For the rest, do not worry about the good causeb (of 
practical reason), for that never comes into play in a merely speculative 
dispute. In this case the dispute reveals nothing but a certain antinomy 
of reason, which, since it depends upon its nature, must necessarily be 
heard and examined. The conflict cultivates reason by the consideration 
of its object on both sides, and corrects its judgment by thus limiting it. 
What is here in dispute is not the marterC but the tone. For enough remains 
left to you to speak the language, justified by the sharpest reason, 


A745/ B 773 of a firm helief, even though you must surrender that of knowledge. 
If one were to ask the cool-headed David Hume, especially constituted 
for equilibrium of judgment, "What moved you to undermine, by 
means of reservations brooded on with so much effort, the persuasion, 
so comforting and useful for humans, that the insight of their reason is 
adequate for the assertion and determinate concept of a highest 
being?",rs he would answer: "Nothing but the intention of bringing 
reason further in its self-knowledge,d and at the same time a certain 
aversion to the coercion which one would exercise against reason by 
treating it as great and yet at the same time preventing a free confession 
of its weaknesses, which become obvious to it in the examination of itself." 
But if, on the contrary, you were to ask Priestley, 16 who is devoted 
only to the principles of the empirical use of reason and is disinclined 
to all transcendental speculation, what sort of motives he had for tearing 
down two such pillars of all religion as the freedom and immortality 
of our soul (the hope of a future life is according to him merely the 
expectation of a miracle of resurrection), he, who is himself a pious and

The discipline of pure reason in polemical use 
eager teacher of religion, would not be able to answer anything other 
than: the interest of reason, which is diminished by the exemption of 
certain objects from the laws of material nature, which are the only ones 
that we can know and determine with precision. It would seem unfair A746/Bh774 
to decry the latter, who knew how to unite his paradoxical assertion 
with the aim of religion, and to do injury to a well-meaning man because 
he could not find his bearings as soon as he left the field of theory 
and nature. But this favor must likewise be shown to the no less 
well-intentioned Hume, unblemished in his moral character, who cannot 
forsake his abstract speculation because he rightly holds that its object 
lies entirely beyond the boundaries of natural science, in the field 
of pure ideas. 
Now what is to be done, especially in regard to the danger which 
seems to threaten the common good from this quarter? Nothing is 
more natural, nothing more equitable than the decision that you have 
to make. Let these people do what they want; if they exhibit talent, if 
they exhibit deep and new research, in a word, if only they exhibit reason, 
then reason always wins. If you grasp at means other than uncoerced 
reason, if you cry high treason, if you call together the public, 
which understands nothing of such subtle refinements, as if they were 
to put out a fire, then you make yourself ridiculous. For the issue is not 
what is advantageous or disadvantageous to the common good in these 
matters, but only how far reason can get in its speculation in abstraction A 747 IB775 
from all interest, and whether one can count on such speculation at all 
or must rather give it up altogether in favor of the practical. Thus instead 
of charging in with a sword, you should instead watch this conflict 
peaceably from the safe seat of critique, a conflict which must be exhausting 
for the combatants but entertaining for you, with an outcome 
that will certainly be bloodless and advantageous for your insight. For 
it is quite absurd to expect enlightenment from reason and yet to prescribe 
to it in advance on which side it must come out. Besides, reason 
is already so well restrained and held within limits by reason itself that 
you do not need to call out the guard to put up civil resistance against 
that party whose worrisome superiority seems dangerous to you. In this 
dialectic there is no victory about which you would have cause to worry. 
Reason also very much needs such a conflict, and it is to be wished 
that it had been undertaken earlier and with unlimited public permission. 
For then a mature critique would have come about all the earlier, 
at the appearance of which all of this controversy would have had to disappear, 
since the disputants would have learned insight into the illusion 
and prejudices that have disunited them. 
There is a certain dishonesty a in human nature, which yet in the end, 
a Unlauterkeit 



Doctrine of Method. Ch. I. Sec. II 


A748 / B 776 like everything else that comes from nature, must contain a tendency to 
good purposes, namely an inclination to hide its true dispositions and 
to make a show of certain assumed ones that are held to be good and 
creditable. It is quite certain that through this propensity to conceal 
themselves as well as to assume an appearance that is advantageous for 
them humans have not merely civilized themselves but gradually moralized 
themselves to a certain degree, since no one could penetrate the 
mask of respectability, honorableness, and propriety, and one therefore 
found a school for self-improvement in the supposedly genuine examples 
of the good which he saw around himself. Yet this tendencya to 
pretend to be better than one is and to express dispositionsb that one 
does not have serves as it were only provisionally to bring the human 
being out of his crudeness and first allow him to assume at least the 
manner of the good, which he recognizes; for later, when the genuine 
principles have finally been developed and incorporated into his way of 
thought, that duplicity must gradually be vigorously combated, for otherwise 
it corrupts the heart, and good dispositions cannot grow among 
the rampant weeds of fair appearance 
I am sorry to perceive the very same dishonesty, misrepresentation, 
and hypocrisy even in the utterances of the speculative way of thinking, 
where human beings have far fewer hindrances to and no advantage at 
all in forthrightly confessing their thoughts openly and unreservedly. 


A749/ B 777 For what can be more disadvantageous to insight than falsely communicating 
even mere thoughts, than concealing doubts which we feel 
about our own assertions, or giving a semblance of self-evidence to 
grounds of proof which do not satisfy ourselves? As long as these 
machinations arise merely from private vanity (which is usually the case 
in speculative judgments, which have no special interest and are not 
readily liable to apodictic certainty), then the vanity of others resists 
them with public approval, and in the end things end up at the same 
point to which they would have been brought, though much earlier, by 
the most honest disposition and sincerity. But where the public holds 
that subtle sophistsd are after nothing less than to shake the foundation 
of the public welfare, then it seems not only prudent but also permissible 
and even creditable to come to the aid of the good cause with spurious 
grounds rather than to give its putative enemies even the 
advantage of lowering our voice to the modesty of a merely practical 
conviction and necessitating us to admit the lack of speculative and apodictic 
certainty. I should think, however, that there is nothing in the 


" Anlage 
b Gesinnungen 
, des scho"nen Scheins 
d Vernunftler 
648 

The discipline of pure reason in polemical use 

world less compatible with the aim of maintaining a good cause than 
duplicity, misrepresentation, and treachery. That in weighing up the rational 
grounds of a mere speculation everything must proceed honor-A750/ B 778 
ably seems to be the least that one can demand. If one could securely 
count even on this minimum, however, then the dispute of speculative 
reason about the important questions of God, immortality (of the soul), 
and freedom would either have long been decided or else would be 
brought to an end very soon. Thus honesty of disposition often stands 
in an inverse relationa to the goodness of the cause itself, and the latter 
has perhaps more upright and sincere opponents than defenders. 

I therefore presuppose readers who would not want a just cause to be 
defended with injustice. Now with regard to them it is already decided 
that, in accordance with our principles of critique, if one looks not to 
what happens but to what properly should happen, then there really 
must not be any polemic of pure reason. For how can two people conduct 
a dispute about a matter the reality of which neither of them can 
exhibit in an actual or even in a merely possible experience, about the 
idea of which he only broods in order to bring forth from it something 
more than an idea, namely the actuality of the object itself? By what 
means would they escape from the dispute, since neither can make his 
cause directly comprehensible and certain, but rather can only attack 
and refute that of his opponent? For this is the fate of all assertions of 
pure reason: that since they go beyond the conditions of all possible A75 IIB 779 
experience, outside of which no document of truth is ever to be encountered, 
yet at the same time must make use of the laws of the understanding, 
which are destined merely for empirical use but without 
which no step may be taken in synthetic thought, they must always be 
exposed to the enemy, and each can take advantage of the exposure of 
his enemy. 

One can regard the critique of pure reason as the true court of justice 
for all controversies of pure reason; for the critique is not involved in 
these disputes, which pertain immediately to objects,b but is rather set 
the task of determining and judging what is lawfulc in reason in general 
in accordance with the principles of its primary institution. 

WIthout this, reason is as it were in the state of nature, and it cannot 
make its assertions and claims valid or secure them except through war. 
The critique, on the contrary, which derives all decisions from the 
ground-rules of its own constitution, whose authority no one can doubt, 
grants us the peace of a state of law,d in which we should not conduct 

a Verhdltnisse 
b Objecte 
C die Rechtsame 
d eines gestzlichen Zustandes 
649

our controversy except by due process. What brings the quarrel in the 
state of nature to an end is a victory, of which both sides boast, although 
for the most part there follows only an uncertain peace, arranged by an 

A 752/B 780 authority in the middle; but in the state of law it is the verdict, which, 
since it goes to the origin of the controversies themselves, must secure 
a perpetual peace. And the endless controversies of a merely dogmatic 
reason finally make it necessary to seek peace in some sort of critique of 
this reason itself, and in a legislation grounded upon it; just as Hobbes 
asserted, the state of nature is a state of injustice and violence, and one 
must necessarily leave it in order to submit himself to the lawful coercion 
which alone limits our freedom in such a way that it can be consistent 
with the freedom of everyone else and thereby with the common 
good.l? 


To this freedom, then, there also belongs the freedom to exhibit the 
thoughts and doubts which one cannot resolve oneself for public judgment 
without thereupon being decried as a malcontent and a dangerous 
citizen. This lies already in the original right of human reason, which 
recognizes no other judge than universal human reason itself, in which 
everyone has a voice; and since all improvement of which our condition 
is capable must come from this, such a right is holy, and must not be 
curtailed. It is also very unwise to denounce as dangerous certain daring 
assertions or audacious attacks upon that which already has on its 
side the approval of the greatest and best part of the public: for that 

A753/B781 would be to give them an importance that they should not have at all. 
When I hear that an uncommon mind has demonstrated away the freedom 
of the human will, the hope of a future life, and the existence of 
God, I am eager to read the book, for I expect that his talent will advance 
my insights. I am completely certain in advance that he will not 
have accomplished any of this, not because I believe myself already to 
be in possession of incontrovertible proofs of these important propositions, 
but rather because the transcendental critique, which has revealed 
to me the entire stock of our pure reason, has completely convinced me 
that just as pure reason is entirely inadequate for affirmative assertions 
in this field, even less will it know what to do in order to be able to assert 
something negative about these questions. For where would the 
supposed free-thinker derive his knowledge that, there is, e.g., no highest 
being? This proposition lies outside the field of possible experience, 
and therefore also beyond the boundaries of all human insight. The 
dogmatic defender of the good cause against this enemy I would not 
read at all, because I know in advance that he will only attack the illusory 
grounds of the other in order to gain entry for his own, and that 
an everyday illusion does not give as much material for new observations 
as an alien one that is sensibly thought out. The enemy of reli-

A 7541B 782 gion, on the contrary, who is dogmatic in his own way, would give my 

650 



The discipline of pure reason in polemical use 

critique desirable occupation and occasion for some refinement of its 

principles, without his principles being anything to fear in the least. 
But should not the young, at least, who are entrusted to academic instruction, 
be warned about writings of that sort, and be protected from 
premature acquaintance with such dangerous propositions, until their 
power of judgment has matured or rather the doctrine that one would 
ground in them has become firmly rooted, in order vigorously to resist 
all persuasion to the contrary, from wherever it might come? 
If matters of pure reason had to be left to dogmatic procedures, and 

if the opponents really had to be disposed of polemically, i.e., in such a 

way that one must enter into battle armed with grounds of proof against 

opposed assertions, then nothing would be more advisable in the short 

run, but at the same time nothing more vain and fruitless in the long 

run, than to place the reason of the young under tutelage for a long 

time and protect it against seduction for at least as long. But when, sub


sequently, either curiosity or the fashion of the age should put writings 

of that sort in their hands, would that youthful persuasion then hold 

fast? He who brings with him nothing but dogmatic weapons to resist 

the attacks of his opponent, and who does not know how to develop the 

hidden dialectic which lies no less in his own breast than in that of his A7551 B 783 

counterpart, sees illusory grounds that have the advantage of novelty 

step forth against illusory grounds that no longer have that advantage 

but which instead arouse the suspicion of having abused the credulity of 

the young. He believes that he cannot better show that he has outgrown 

the discipline of childhood than by setting himself above those well-in


tended warnings, and, accustomed to dogmatism, he takes long drafts 

of the poison that dogmatically corrupts his principles. 
Exactly the opposite of that which has just been recommended must 
take place in academic education, although, to be sure, only under the 
presupposition of a thorough instruction in the critique of pure reason. 
For in order to put the principleso of the latter into practice as early as 
possible and to show their adequacy against the greatest dialectical illusion, 
it is absolutely necessary to direct the attacks that would be so 
fearsome for the dogmatist against the reason of the student, which is 
still weak but is enlightened by critique, and allow him to make the experiment 
of examining the groundless assertions of his opponents one 
by one in light of those principles. It cannot be difficult for him to dissolve 
those arguments into thin air, and thus he feels early his own 
power to defend himself fully against harmful deceptions of that sort, 
which must in the end lose all their plausibilityb for him. But now 
whether the very same blows that bring down the edifice of the enemy A756/B784 

Principien 
b Schein 

a 


651

must also be just as damaging to his own speculative structure, should 
he think of erecting anything of the sort: about that he is entirely unconcerned, 
because he does not need to dwell in that, but rather still has 
before him a prospect in the practical field, where with good ground he 
can hope for a firmer terrain on which to erect his rational and salutary 
system. 

There is accordingly no real polemic in the field of pure reason. Both 
parties fence in the air and wrestle with their shadows, for they go beyond 
nature, where there is nothing that their dogmatic grasp can seize 
and hold. Fight as they may, the shadows that they cleave apart grow 
back together in an instant, like the heroes of Valhalla, to amuse themselves 
anew in bloodless battles. 

However, there is also no permissible skeptical use of pure reason, 
which one could call the principle of its neutrality in all controversies. 
To incite reason against itself, to hand it weapons on both sides, and 
then to watch its heated struggle quietly and scornfully is not seemly 
from a dogmatic point of view, but rather has the look of a spiteful and 
malicious cast of mind. If, however, one takes regard of the inexorable 
deception and bragging of the sophists, who will not be moderated by 

757/B 785 any critique, then there is really no other course but to set the boasting 
of one side against another, which stands on the same rights, in order at 
least to shock reason, by means of the resistance of an enemy, into raising 
some doubts about its pretensions and giving a hearing to the critique. 
But for reason to leave just these doubts standing, and to set out 
to recommend the conviction and confession of its ignorance, not 
merely as a cure for dogmatic self-conceit but also as the way in which 
to end the conflict of reason with itself, is an entirely vain attempt, by 
no means suitable for arranging a peaceful retirement for reason; rather 
it is at best only a means for awaking it from its sweet dogmatic dreams 
in order to undertake a more careful examination of its condition. 
Since, however, this skeptical manner of withdrawing from a tedious 
quarrel of reason seems to be the shortcut, as it were, for arriving at enduring 
philosophical tranquility, or at least the high road that is happily 
recommended by those who would give a philosophical appearance to 
a scornful contempt for all investigations of this kind, I find it necessary 
to exhibit this manner of thought in its true light. 


On the 
impossibility of a skeptical satisfaction 
of pure reason that is divided against itself. IS 

The consciousness of my ignorance (if this is not at the same. time 
known to be necessary) should not end my inquiries, but is rather the 

652 



The discipline of pure reason in polemical use 

proper cause to arouse them. All ignorance is either that of things a or 
of the determination and boundaries of my cognition. Now if the ignorance 
is contingent, then in the first case it must drive me to investigate 
the things (objects) dogmatically, in the second case to investigate the 
boundaries of my possible cognition critically. But that my ignorance 
is absolutely necessary and hence absolves me from all further investigation 
can never be made out empirically, from observation, but only 
critically, bygetting to the bottom Ofb the primary sources of our cognition. 
Thus the determination of the boundaries of our reason can 
only take place in accordance with apriori grounds; its limitation, however, 
which is a merely indeterminate cognition of an ignorance that is 
never completely to be lifted, can also be cognized a posteriori, through 
that which always remains to be known even with all of our knowledge. 
The former cognition of ignorance, which is possible only by means of 
the critique of reason itself, is thus science, the latter is nothing but 

perception, about which one cannot say how far the inference from it A7591B787 

might reach. If I represent the surface of the earth (in accordance with 

sensible appearancey as a plate, I cannot know how far it extends. But 

experience teaches me this: that wherever I go, I always see a space 

around me in which I could proceed farther; thus I cognize the limits of 

my actual knowledge of the earthd at any time, but not the boundaries 

of all possible description of the earth. But if I have gotten as far as 

knowing that the earth is a sphere and its surface the surface of a sphere, 

then from a small part of the latter, e.g., from the magnitude of one de


gree, I can cognize its diameter and, by means of this, the complete 

boundary, i.e., surface of the earth, determinately and in accordance 

with apriori principles;' and although I am ignorant in regard to the ob


jects that this surface might contain, I am not ignorant in regard to the 
magnitude and limits of the domain that contains them. 
The sum total of all possible objects for our cognition seems to us to 

be a flat surface, which has its apparent horizon, namely that which 
comprehends its entire domain and which is called by us the rational 
concept of unconditioned totality. It is impossible to attain this empirically, 
and all attempts to determine it apriori in accordance with a cer


tain principle! have been in vain. Yet all questions of our pure reason A7601 B788 

pertain to that which might lie outside this horizon or in any case at 
least on its borderline.

The famous David Hume was one of these geographers of human 
reason, who took himself to have satisfactorily disposed of these questions 
by having expelled them outside the horizon of human reason, 
which however he could not determine. He dwelt primarily on the principle 
of causality, and quite rightly remarked about that that one could 
not base its truth (indeed not even the objective validity of the concept 
of an efficient cause in general) on any insight at all, i.e., a priori cognition, 
and thus that the authority of this law is not constituted in the least 
by its necessity, but only by its merely general usefulness in the course 
of experience and a subjective necessity arising therefrom, which he 
called custom.I9 Now from the incapacity of our reason to make a use 
of this principle that goes beyond all experience, he inferred the nullity 
of all pretensions of reason in general to go beyond the empirical. 

One can call a procedure of this sort, subjecting the facta of reason to 
examination and when necessary to blame, the censorship of reason. It 
is beyond doubt that this censorship inevitably leads to doubtabout all 

A761o/ B 789 transcendent use of principles. But this is only the second step, which is 
far from completing the work. The first step in matters of pure reason, 
which characterizes its childhood, is dogmatic. The just mentioned 
second step is skeptical, and gives evidencea of the caution of the power 
of judgment sharpened by experience. Now, however, a third step is still 
necessary, which pertains only to the mature and adult power!' of judgment, 
which has at its basis firm maxims of proven universality, that, 
namely, which subjects to evaluation not the facta of reason but reason 
itself, as concerns its entire capacityc and suitability for pure a priori 
cognitions; this is not the censorship but the critique of pure reason, 
whereby not merely limits but rather the determinate boundaries of 
it -not merely ignorance in one part or another but ignorance in 
regard to all possible questions of a certain sort -are not merely suspected 
but are proved from principles.d Thus skepticism is a restingplace 
for human reason, which can reflect upon its dogmatic peregrination 
and make a survey of the region in which it finds itself in order 
to be able to choose its path in the future with greater certainty, but it 
is not a dwelling-place for permanent residence; for the latter can only 
be found in a complete certainty, whether it be one of the cognition of 
the objects themselves or of the boundaries within which all of our cog-

A762/ B 790 nition of objects is enclosed. 
Our reason is not like an indeterminably extended plane, the limits of 

a zeugt; in A, zeigt. Ifzeugt is a misprint introduced in E, then the translation would be

The discipline of pure reason in polemical use 

which one can cognize only in general, but must rather be compared 
with a sphere, the radius of which can be found out from the curvature 
of an arc on its surface (from the nature of synthetic a priori propositions), 
from which its content and its boundary can also be ascertained 
with certainty. Outside this sphere (field of experience) nothing is an 
object" for it; indeed even questions about such supposed objects concern 
only subjective principlesb of a thoroughgoing determination of 
the relationsc that can obtain among the concepts of understanding inside 
of this sphere. 

We are really in possession of synthetic apriori cognition, as is established 
by the principles of understanding, which anticipate experience. 
Now if someone cannot even make the possibility of these comprehensible 
to himself, he may certainly begin to doubt whether they are really 
present in us a priori; but he cannot declare this to be an impossibility 
through the mere power of the understanding, and declare to be nugatory 
all of the steps that reason takes in accordance with their guidance. 
He can only say: If we had insight into their origin and authenticity, 
then we would be able to determine the domain and the boundaries of 
our reason; but until this has happened, all assertions of the latter are A763 / B79I 
shots in the dark. And in such a way a thoroughgoing doubt of all dogmatic 
philosophy that goes its way without any critique of reason itself 
would be entirely well founded; yet reason cannot on that account be 
entirely denied such a progress, if it is prepared and secured through 
better groundwork.d For one thing, all the concepts, indeed all the questions 
that pure reason lays before us, lie not in experience but themselves 
in turn only in reason, and they must therefore be able to be 
solved and their validity or nullity must be able to be comprehended. 
We are, also, not justified in repudiating these problems under the excuse 
of our incapacity, as if their solution really lay in the nature of 
things, and in rejecting further investigation, since reason has given 
birth to these ideas from its own womb alone, and is therefore liable to 
give account of either their validity or their dialectical illusion. 

All skeptical polemicizing is properly directed only against the dogmatist, 
who continues gravely along his path without any mistrust of his 
original objective principles,' i.e., without critique, in order to unhinge 
his concept! and bring him to self-knowledge.g In itself it settles nothing 
at all about what we can know and what by contrast we cannot

A764/ B792 know. All failed dogmatic attempts of reason are facta, which it is always 
useful to subject to censure. But this cannot decide anything about reason's 
expectations of hoping for better success in its future efforts and 
making claims to that; mere censure can therefore never bring to an end 
the controversy about what is lawfula in human reason. 

Since Hume is perhaps the most ingenious of all skeptics, and is incontrovertibly 
the preeminent one with regard to the influence that the 
skeptical procedure can have on awakening a thorough examination of 
reason, it is well worth the trouble to make clear, to the extent that is 
appropriate to my aim, the path of his inferences and the aberrations of 
such an insightful and valuable man, which nevertheless began on the 
trail of truth. 


Hume perhaps had it in mind, although he never fully developed it, 
that in judgments of a certain kind we go beyond our concept of the object. 
I have called this sort of judgment synthetic. There is no difficulty 
about how, by means of experience, I can go beyond the concepts that I 
possess thus far. Experience is itself a synthesis of perceptions that augments 
my concept which I have by means of one perception by the addition 
of others. But we also believe ourselves to be able to go beyond 

A765 / B 793 our concepts a priori and to amplify our cognition. We attempt to do this 
either through pure understanding, with regard to that which can at 
least be an ob;ecti' of experience, or even through pure reason, with regard 
to such properties of things, or even with regard to the existence of 
such objects, that can never come forth in experience. Our skeptic did 
not distinguish these two kinds of judgments, as he should have, and for 
that reason held this augmentation of concepts out of themselves and the 
parthenogenesis, so to speak, of our understanding (together with reason), 
without impregnation by experience, to be impossible; thus he held 
all of its supposedly a priori principles' to be merely imagined, and found 
that they are nothing but a custom arising from experience and its laws, 
thus are merely empirical, i.e., intrinsically contingent rules, to which we 
ascribe a supposed necessity and universality. However, for the assertion 
of this disturbing proposition he referred to the universally acknowledged 
principle of the relationship of cause to effect. Since in that case 
no faculty of understanding can lead us from the concept of a thing to 
the existence of something else which is thereby universally and necessarily 
given, he believed that he could infer from this that without experience 
we have nothing that could augment our concept and justify us in 
making such a judgment, which amplifies itself a priori. That the sunlight

The discipline of pure reason in polemical use 

standing could not discover let alone lawfully infer from the concepts 
that we antecedently have of these things, and only experience could 
teach us such a law. In the transcendental logic, on the contrary, we have 
seen that although of course we can never immediately go beyond the 
content of the concept which is given to us, nevertheless we can still cognize 
the law of the connection with other things completely apriori, although 
in relation to a third thing, namely possible experience, but still 
apriori. Thus if wax that was previously firm melts, I can cognize a priori 
that something must have preceded (e.g., the warmth of the sun) on 
which this has followed in accordance with a constant law, though without 
experience, to be sure, I could determinately cognize neither the 
cause from the effect nor the effect from the cause apriori and without 
instruction from experience. He therefore falsely inferred from the contingency 
of our determination in accordance with the law the contingency 
of the law itself, and he confused going beyond the concept of a 
thing to possible experience (which takes place a priori and constitutes 
the objective reality of the concept) with the synthesis of the objects of 
actual experience, which is of course always empirical; thereby, however, 
he made a principled of affinity, which has its seat in the understanding 
and asserts necessary connection, into a rule of association, which is 
found merely in the imitative imagination and which can present only A767/ B795 
contingent combinations, not objective ones at all. 


The skeptical aberrations of this otherwise extremely acute man, however, 
arose primarily from a failing that he had in common with all dogmatists, 
namely, that he did not systematically survey all the kinds of a 
priori synthesis of the understanding. For had he done so, he would have 
found, not to mention any others here, that e.g., the principle of persistence 
is one that anticipates experience just as much as that of 
causality. He would thereby have been able to mark out determinate 
boundaries for the understanding that expands itself apriori and for pure 
reason. But since he merely limits our understanding without drawing 
boundaries for it, and brings about a general distrust but no determinate 
knowledgeb of the ignorance that is unavoidable for us, by censuring certain 
principles of the understanding without placing this understanding 
in regard to its entire capacityc on the scales of critique, and, while rightly 
denying to understanding what it really cannot accomplish, goes further, 
and disputes all its capacityd to expand itself a priori without having assessed 
this entire capacity, the same thing happens to him that always 
brings down skepticism, namely, he is himself doubted, for his objections 

a

Doctrine of Method. Ch. I. Sec. III 

rest only on facta, which are contingent, but not on principles a that could 

A 7681 B 796 effect a necessary renunciation of the right to dogmatic assertions. 
Further, since he does not know the difference between the well 
founded claims of the understanding and the dialectical pretensions of 
reason, against which his attacks are chiefly directed, reason, whose entirely 
peculiar momentum is not in the least disturbed, but only hindered, 
does not feel that the room for its expansion is cut off, and 
although it is annoyed here and there it can never be entirely dissuaded 
from its efforts. For it is armed to parry attacks, and is all the more obstinate 
in attempting to carry out its demands. But a complete overview 
of its entire capacity and the conviction arising from that of the certainty 
of a small possession, even in case of the vanity of higher claims, 
put an end to all dispute, and move it to rest satisfied with a limited but 
undisputed property. 

Against the uncritical dogmatist, who has not measured the sphere of 
his understanding and thus has not determined the boundaries of his 
possible cognition in accordance with principles,b who therefore does 
not already know in advance how much he is capable of but thinks he 
can find it out through mere experiments, these skeptical attacks are not 
merely dangerous but are even disastrous. For ifhe is hit in a single as


A769/B797 sertion that he cannot justify or make plausible by means of principles,c 
then suspicion falls upon all of them, however persuasive they might 
otherwise be. 

And thus the skeptic is the taskmaster of the dogmatic sophist for a 
healthy critique of the understanding and of reason itself. When he has 
gotten this far he does not have to fear any further challenge, for he 
then distinguishes his possession from that which lies entirely outside 
it, to which he makes no claims and about which he cannot become involved 
in any controversies. Thus the skeptical procedure is not, to be 
sure, itself satisfying for questions of reason, but it is nevertheless 
preparatoryfor arousing its caution and showing it fundamental means 
for securing it in its rightful possessions.

The 
discipline of pure reason with regard 
to hypotheses. 


Since, then, through the critique of our reason we finally know that we 
cannot in fact know anything at all in its pure and speculative use,

The discipline of pure reason in hypotheses 

should it not then open up an all the wider field for hypotheses, since 
it is at least granted to reason to invent" and to opine, if not to assert? 

If the imagination is not simply to enthuse but is, under the strict AnO/B 798 
oversight of reason, to invent,b something must always first be fully certain 
and not invented,c or a mere opinion, and that is the possibility of 
the object itself. In that case it is permissible to take refuge in opinion 
concerning the actuality of the object, which opinion, however, in order 
not to be groundless, must be connected as a ground of explanation 
with that which is actually given and consequently certain, and it is then 
called an hypothesis.20 

Now since we cannot construct a priori the least concept of the possibility 
of dynamical connection, and the category of the pure understanding 
does not serve for thinking up such a thing but only for 
understanding it where it is encountered in experience, we cannot originally 
cook up,d in accordance with these categories, a single object with 
any new and not empirically given property and ground a permissible 
hypothesis on it; for this would be to found reason on empty figments 
of the brain rather than concepts of things. Thus we are not allowed to 
think up any sort of new original forces, e.g., an understanding that is 
capable of intuiting its object without sense or an attractive force without 
any contact, or a new kind of substance, e.g., one which would be 
present in space without impenetrability; consequently we also cannot 
conceive of any community of substances that would be different from An I /B799 
anything that experience provides;2I no presence except in space, no duration 
except merely in time. In a word: it is only possible for our reason 
to use the conditions of possible experience as conditions of the 
possibility of things; but it is by no means possible for it as it were to 
create new ones, independent of these conditions, for concepts of this 
sort, although free of contradiction, would nevertheless also be without 
any object. 

The concepts of reason are, as we have said, mere ideas, and of course 
have no object in any sort of experience, but also do not on that account 
designate objects that are inventede and at the same time thereby assumed 
to be possible. They are merely thought problematically, in 
order to ground regulative principles! of the systematic use of the understanding 
in the field of experience in relation to them (as heuristic 
fictions). If one departs from this, they are mere thought-entities, the

possibility of which is not demonstrable, and which thus cannot be used 
to ground the explanation of actual appearances through an hypothesis. 
It is entirely permissible to think the soul as simple in order, in accordance 
with this idea, to make a complete and necessary unity of all 
powers of the mind, even though one cannot have insight into it in concreto, 
into the principlea of our judgment of its inner appearances. But 
to assume the soul as simple substance (a transcendent concept) would 
be a proposition that would not only be indemonstrable (as is the case 

A 772 /B800 with many physical hypotheses), but which would also be hazarded entirely 
arbitrarily and blindly, since the simple cannot come forth in any 
experience at all, and, if one here understands by substance the persistent 
objectb of sensible intuition, there can be no insight at all into 
the possibility of a simple appearance. Merely intelligible beings or 
merely intelligible properties of the things of the sensible world cannot 
be assumed as opinions with any well-founded authority of reason, although 
(since one has no concept of either their possibility or their impossibility) 
they also cannot be dogmatically denied on the basis of any 
supposedly better insight. 
For the explanation of given appearances no other things and 
grounds of explanation can be adduced than those which are connected 
to the given appearances by already known laws of appearances. A transcendental 
hypothesis, in which a mere idea of reason would be used 
for the explanation of things in nature, would thus be no explanation at 
all, since that which one does not adequately understand on the basis of 
known empirical principlesc would be explained by means of something 
about which one understands nothing at all. And the principled of such 
an hypothesis would really serve only for the satisfaction of reason and 
not for the advancement of the use of the understanding in regard to 
objects. Order and purposiveness in nature must in turn be explained 
from natural grounds and in accordance with laws of nature, and here 

A773o/ B801 even the wildest hypotheses, as long as they are physical, are more tolerable 
than a hyperphysical hypothesis, i.e., the appeal to a divine author, 
which one presupposes to this end. For that would be a principle' 
of lazy reason (ignava ratio), at once bypassing all causes, of whose objective 
reality, at least as far as possibility is concerned, one could still 
learn through continued experience, in order to take refuge in a mere 
idea, which is very comforting to reason. As far as the absolute totality 
of the ground of explanation in the series of those causes is concerned,

The discipline of pure reason in hypotheses 

however, that can create no difficulty with regard to the objects of the 
world,a for since these are nothing but appearances, nothing that is 
completed in the synthesis of the series of conditions can be hoped for 
from them. 

Transcendental hypotheses of the speculative use of reason and a 
freedom to make good the lack of physical grounds of explanation by 
using all sorts of hyper physical ones can never be permitted at all, partly 
because reason is not advanced by them but rather cut off from all 
progress in their use, and partly because this license must ultimately destroy 
all fruits of the cultivation of its own proper soil, namely experience. 
For whenever the explanation of nature becomes difficult, we 
always have at hand a transcendental ground of explanation that spares 
us that inquiry, and our research is concluded not through insight but A774/B 802 
through the total incomprehensibility of a principleb which was thought 
up so far in advance that it must have contained the concept of that 
which is absolutely first. 


The second point which is requisite to make an hypothesis worthy of 
being assumed is its adequacy for determining apriori the consequences 
these are given. If for this purpose auxiliary hypotheses need to be 
called in, they arouse the suspicion of being a mere invention, since 
each of them requires the same justification which the underlying 
thought needed, and hence can give no reliable testimony. If on the presupposition 
of an unlimitedly perfect cause there is no lack of grounds 
of explanation for all the purposiveness, order, and greatnessc that is 
found in the world, then the deviations from these and the evils that reveal 
themselves, at least according to our concepts, require still further 
hypotheses in order to save the first from these objections. If the simple 
self-sufficiency of the human soul, which has been laid at the ground 
of its appearances, is impugned by difficulties because these are phenomena 
similar to the alterations of matter (growth and decay), then 
new hypotheses must be called in to help, which are not without plausibility 
but are still without any confirmation, except that which is given 
to them by the opinion assumed as the primary ground, which they 
were supposed to explain. 

If the assertions of reason that have here been adduced as examples 
(incorporeal unity of the soul and existence of a highest being) are not 
to count as hypotheses, but as dogmata proven a priori, then they are 
not even an issue. In that case, however, one would indeed take care that 
the proof have the apodictic certainty of a demonstration. For to make 
the actuality of such ideas merely probable is an absurd proposal, just

as if one thought to prove a proposition of geometry as merely probable. 
Reason in abstraction from all experience can cognize everything 
only apriori and necessarily, or not at all; hence its judgment is never an 
opinion, but either abstention from all judgment or apodictic certainty. 
Opinions and probable judgments about what pertains to things can 
occur only as grounds of explanation of that which is actually given or 
as consequences in accordance with empirical laws of that which actually 
grounds what is actually given; thus they can occur only in the series 
of objects of experience. To fonn opinions outside this field is the 
same as to play with thoughts, unless one merely has the opinion that 
an uncertain path of judgment can perhaps lead to truth. 

A776/B 804 However, although in merely speculative questions of pure reason no 
hypotheses are allowed to ground propositions, they are nevertheless 
entirely admissible for defending them, i.e., not in dogmatic but in 
polemical use. By defense, however, I understand not the augmentation 
of grounds of proof for its assertion, but rather the mere frustration of 
the opponent's illusory insights, which would demolish our own asserted 
propositions. But now all synthetic propositions from pure reason 
have the peculiarity that if 
he who asserts the reality of certain ideas 
never knows enough to make his proposition certain, on the other side 
his opponent can just as little know enough to assert the contrary. This 
equality in the lot of human reason favors neither of them in speculative 
cognitions, and there is thus the true battleground of feuds that can 
never be resolved. It will be shown in what follows, however, that in regard 
to its practical use reason still has the right to assume something 
which it would in no way be warranted in presupposing in the field of 
mere speculation without sufficient grounds of proof; for all such presuppositions 
injure the perfection of speculation, about which, however, 
the practical interest does not trouble itself at al1. There it thus has a 
possession the legitimacy of which need not be proved, and the proof of 


A777 / B805 which it could not in fact give. The opponent should therefore prove. 
But since he no more knows something about the object that is doubted 
which would establish its non-being than does the former, who asserts 
its actuality, here an advantage on the side of he who asserts something 
as a practically necessary presupposition (melior est conditio possidentis)a is 
revealed. He is, namely, free to use, as it were in an emergency, the very 
same means for his good causeb as his opponent would use against it, 
i.e., to use the hypotheses that do not serve to strengthen the proof of 
it but serve only to show that the opponent understands far too little 
about the object of the dispute to be able to flatter himself with an advantage 
in speculative insight over us.

The discipline of pure reason in hypotheses 

Hypotheses are therefore allowed in the field of pure reason only as 
weapons of war, not for grounding a right but only for defending it. 
However, we must always seek the enemy here in ourselves. For speculative 
reason in its transcendental use is dialectical in itself. The objections 
that are to be feared lie in ourselves. We must search them out like 
old but unexpired claims, in order to ground perpetual peace on their 
annihilation. External quiet is only illusory. The seed of the attacks, 

which lies in the nature of human reason, must be extirpated; but how 
can we extirpate it if we do not give it freedom, indeed even nourish-A778/ B806 
ment, to send out shoots, so that we can discover it and afterwards erad


icate it with its root? Thus, think up for yourself the objections which 
have not yet occurred to any opponent, and even lend him the weapons 
or concede him the most favorable position that he could desire. There 
is nothing in this to fear, though much to hope, namely that you will 

come into a possession that can never be attacked in the future. 
Now to your complete armament there also belong the hypotheses of 
pure reason, which, although they are merely leaden weapons (for they 
have not been steeled through any law of experience), are nevertheless 
just as capable as those which any opponent might use against you. If, 
therefore, you come up against the difficulty for the immaterial nature 
of the soul which is not subjected to any corporeal transformation (assumed 
in some other, non-speculative context), the difficulty, namely, 
that experience seems to prove that both the elevation as well as the derangement 
of our mental powers are merely different modifications of 
our organs, you can weaken the power of this proof by assuming that 
our body is nothing but the fundamental appearance to which the entire 
faculty of sensibility and therewith all thinking are related, as their 
condition, in our present state (in life). Separation from the body would 
be the end of this sensible use of your cognitive power and the beginning 
of the intellectual. The body would thus be not the cause of think -A779 / B807 
ing but a merely restricting condition on it, thus it would be regarded 
as furthering the sensible and animal but for that reason all the more as 
hindering the pure and spiritual life, and the dependence of the former 
on the corporeal constitution would prove nothing about the dependence 
of life in its entirety on the state of our organs. But you could go 
even further, and indeed raise new doubts, which have either not been 
suggested before or else have not been driven far enough. 
The contingency of conception, which in humans as well as in irra


tional creatures depends on opportunity, but besides this also on nourishment, 
on government, on its moods and caprices, even on vices, 
presents a great difficulty for the opinion of the eternal duration of a 
creature whose life has first begun under circumstances so trivial and so 
entirely dependent on our liberty. As far as the duration of the entire 
species (here on earth) is concerned, this difficulty amounts to little, 

663 


Doctrine of Method. Ch. r. Sec. III 
since the contingency in the individuaP is nonetheless subjected to a 
rule in the whole; but with regard to each individualb it certainly seems 
questionable to expect such a powerful effect from such inconsequential 
causes. Against this, however, you could propose a transcendental 
A780/ B 808 hypothesis: that all life is really only intelligible, not subject to temporal 
alterations at all, and has neither begun at birth nor will be ended 
through death;' that this life is nothing but a mere appearance, i.e., a 
sensible representation of the purely spiritual life, and the entire world 
of the senses is a mere image, which hovers before our present kind of 
cognition and, like a dream, has no objective reality in itself; that if we 
could intuit the things and ourselves as they are we would see ourselves 
in a world of spiritual natures with which our only true community had 
not begun with birth nor would not cease with bodily death (as mere 
appearances), etc. 
Now although we do not know or seriously assert the least thing 
about all of this which we have here pleaded against the attack, and it is 
all not even an idea of reason but merely a concept thought up for self-
defense, nevertheless we proceed quite rationally here, showing the op( 
ponent who thinks he has exhausted all of the possibilities by falsely 
representing the lack of their empirical conditions as a proof of the 
complete impossibility of that which is believed by us, that he can span 
the entire field of possible things in themselves through mere laws of 
experience just as little as we can acquire anything for our reason in a 
well-grounded manner outside of experience. He who turns such hypo-
A78I /B 809 the tical countermeasures against the pretensions of his rashly negative 
opponent must not be considered to hold them as his own genuine 
opinions. He abandons them as soon as he has finished off the dogmatic 
self-conceit of his opponent. For as modest and as moderate as it may 
be for someone merely to refuse and deny the assertions of another, as 
soon as he would make these objections valid as proof of the opposite 
his claim would be no less proud and conceited than if he had seized 
hold of the affirmative party and its assertion. 
Thus one sees that in the speculative use of reason hypotheses have 
no validity as opinions in themselves, but only relative to opposed transcendent 
pretensions. For the extension of the principlesd of possible 
experience to the possibility of things in general is just as transcendent 
as the assertion of the objective reality of such concepts, which can 
never find their objects anywhere but outside the boundary of all possible 
experience. What pure reason judges assertorically must be necesa

they do not drown reason in fictions and deceptions. 


First Chapter 
Fourth Section 
The discipline of pure reason in regard 
to its proofs. 


The proofs of transcendental and synthetic propositions are unique 
among all proofs of synthetic apriori cognition in that in their case reason 
may not apply itself directly to the object by means of its concepts, 
but must first establish the objective validity of the concepts and the 
possibility of their synthesis apriori. This is not merely a necessary rule 
of caution, but concerns the essence and the possibility of the proofs 
themselves. It is impossible for me to go beyond the concept of an object 
apriori without a special clue which is to be found outside of this 
concept. In mathematics it is apriori intuition that guides my synthesis, 
and there all inferences can be immediately drawn from a pure intuition. 

In transcendental cognition, as long as it has to do merely with concepts A783 / B8II 

of the understanding, this guideline is possible experience. The proof 
does not show, that is, that the given concept (e.g., of that which happens) 
leads directly to another concept (that of a cause), for such a 
transition would be a leap for which nothing could be held responsible; 
rather it shows that experience itself, hence the objectb of experience, 
would be impossible without such a connection. The proof, 
therefore, had to indicate at the same time the possibility of achieving 
synthetically and apriori a certain cognition of things which is not contained 
in the concept of them. Without attention to this the proofs, like 
water breaking its banks, run wildly across the country, wherever the 
tendency of hidden association may happen to lead them. The illusion 
of conviction, which rests on subjective causes of association and is 
taken for the insight of a natural affinity, cannot balance the misgiving 

to which steps risked in this way properly give rise. Hence all attempts 

to prove the principle of sufficient reason have also, according to the 

a 

Following the second edition, which reads "von"; thefirst has "an." 
b Object

general consensus of experts, been in vain, and, since one still could not 
abandon this principle, until the transcendental critique came onto the 
scene one preferred obstinately to appeal to healthy human under-

A784/ B 8I2 standing (a refuge, which always proves that the cause of reason is in despair) 
rather than to attempt new dogmatic proofs. 
But if the proposition of which a proof is to be given is an assertion 
of pure reason, and if I would even go beyond my concepts of experience 
by means of mere ideas, then all the more must this proof contain 
the justification of such a step of synthesis (if it would otherwise be possible) 
as a necessary condition of its probative force. Hence as plausible 
as the supposed proof of the simple nature of our thinking substance 
from the unity of apperception may be, yet it is unavoidably faced with 
the difficulty that, since absolute simplicity is not a concept that can 
be immediately related to a perception, but rather as an idea must be 
merely inferred, there can be no insight at all into how the mere consciousness 
that is contained or at least can be contained in all thinking 
should, even though it is to this extent a simple representation, lead to 
the consciousness and knowledge of a thing in which alone thinking 
can be contained. 22 For if I represent to myself the force of my body in 
motion, it is to that extent absolute unity for me, and my representation 
of it is simple; hence I can also express it through the motion of a point, 
since its volume is not relevant, and without diminution of the force it 
can be represented as being as small as one wants and can even be con-

A78S/B 8I3 ceived of as being located in one point. But I would not infer from this 
that if nothing is given to me except the moving force of a body then 
the body can be conceived of as a simple substance just because its representation 
abstracts from all magnitude of the content of space and is 
therefore simple. Now I discover a paralogism in the fact that the simple 
in the abstract is entirely different from the simple in the objectb 
and that the I, which taken in the first sense comprises no manifold 
within itself, if taken in the second sense, in which it signifies the soul 
itself, can be a very complex concept, namely containing under itself 
and designating quite a lot. Only in order to have any presentiment of 
this paralogism (for without such a provisional conjecture one would 
hardly have any suspicion of the proot), it is always necessary to have at 
hand an enduring criterion of the possibility of such synthetic propositions, 
which prove more than experience can yield, which criterion consists 
in the fact that the proof leads to the required predicate not 
directly but only by means of a principled of the possibility of expand

The discipline of pure reason in proofs 
ing our given concepts apriori to ideas and realizing these. If this caution 
is always used, and if before one even attempts the proof one wisely 
considers how and with what basis for hope one could expect such an 
expansion through pure reason, and whence, in cases of this sort, one 
would derive these insights, which are not developed from concepts and A786/B 814 
which also cannot be anticipated in relation to possible experience, then 
one can be spared many difficult and nevertheless fruitless efforts, since 
one would not attribute to reason anything which obviously exceeds its 
capacity,a but would rather subject reason, which does not gladly suffer 
constraint in the paroxysms of its lust for speculative expansion, to the 
discipline of abstinence. 
The first rule, therefore, is this: to attempt no transcendental proofs 
without having first considered whence one can justifiably derive the 
principles on which one intends to build and with what right one can 
expect success in inferences from them. If they are principles of the understanding 
(e.g., of causality), then it is in vain to try to arrive by their 
means at ideas of pure reason; for those principles are valid only for objects 
of possible experience. If they are to be principles from pure reason, 
then again all effort is in vain. For reason has principles, to be sure, 
but as objective principles they are all dialectical, and can only be valid 
as regulative principlesb of the systematically coherent use of experience. 
But if such ostensible proofs are already given, then oppose the 
non liquetC of your mature power of judgment against their deceptive 
conviction, and even if you cannot yet penetrate their deception you A787 / B 81 5 
still have a perfect right to demand the deduction of the principles that 
are used in them, which, if they are supposed to have arisen from pure 
reason, will never be provided for you. And thus it is not even necessary 
for you to concern yourself with the development and refutation of 
each groundless illusion, but you can dispose of the entire heap of these 
inexhaustible tricks of dialectic at once in the court of a critical reason, 
which demands laws. 
The second peculiarity of transcendental proofs is this: that for each 
transcendental proposition only a single proof can be found. If I am to 
draw an inference not from concepts but rather from the intuition 
which corresponds to a concept, whether it be a pure intuition, as in 
mathematics, or an empirical intuition, as in natural science, the intuition 
that grounds the inference offers me a manifold of material for 
synthetic propositions that I can connect in more than one way, thus allowing 
me to reach the same proposition by different paths since I may 
start out from more than one point.

Every transcendental proposition, however, proceeds solely from one 
concept, and states the synthetic condition of the possibility of the object 
in accordance with this concept. The ground of proof can therefore 
only be unique, since outside this concept there is nothing further by 

A788/B816 means of which the object could be determined, and the proof can 
therefore contain nothing more than the determination of an object in 
general in accordance with this concept, which is also unique. In the 
transcendental analytic we drew, e.g., the principle "Everything that 
happens has a cause" from the unique condition of the objective possibility 
of a concept of that which happens in general, namely that the 
determination of an occurrence in time, and consequently this (occurrence) 
as belonging to experience, would be impossible if it did not 
stand under such a dynamical rule. Now this is also the only possible 
ground of proof; for only through the fact that an object is determined 
for the concept by means of the law of causality does the represented 
occurrence have objective validity, i.e., truth. To be sure, still other 
proofs of this principle, e.g., from contingency, have been attempted;23 
but if this is considered clearly, one cannot discover any characteristic 
of contingency except that of happening, i.e., existence which is preceded 
by a not-being of the object, and one therefore always comes 
back to the same ground of proof. If the proposition "Everything that 
thinks is simple" is to be proved, one does not dwell on the manifoldness 
of thinking, but sticks solely with the concept of the I, which is 
simple and to which all thinking is related. It is just the same with the 
transcendental proof of the existence of God, which depends solely on 

A 7891 B 8 I 7 the reciprocality of the concepts of the most real being and the necessary 
being, and cannot be sought anywhere else. 
Through this cautionary remark the critique of the assertions of reason 
is very much reduced. 􀋻ere reason would conduct its business 
through mere concepts, only a single proof is possible if any proof is 
possible at all. Thus if one sees the dogmatist step forth with ten proofs, 
one can be sure that he has none at all. For if he had one that proved 
apodictically (as must be the case in matters of pure reason), for what 
would he need the rest? His intention is only that of every parliamentary 
advocate: one argument for this one, another one for that, in order 
to take advantage of the weakness of his judges who, without getting 
into the business deeply and in order to get rid of it quickly, just grasp 
at the first argument that occurs to them and decide accordingly. 
The third special rule of pure reason, if it is subjected to a discipline 
in regard to transcendental proofs, is that its proofs must never be apagogic 
but always ostensive. The direct or ostensive proof is, in all 
kinds of cognition, that which is combined with the conviction of truth 
and simultaneously with insight into its sources; the apagogic proof, on 
the contrary, can produce certainty, to be sure, but never comprehensi

The discipline of pure reason in proofs 
bility of the truth in regard to its connection with the grounds of its 
possibility. Hence the latter are more of an emergency aid than a pro-A790/ B 818 
cedure which satisfies all the aims of reason. Yet they have an advantage 
in self-evidence over the direct proofs in this: that a contradiction always 
carries with it more clarity of representation than the best connection, 
and thereby more closely approaches the intuitiveness of a 
demonstration. 
The real cause for the use of apagogic proofs in various sciences is 
probably this. If the grounds from which a certain cognition should 
be derived are too manifold or lie too deeply hidden, then one tries 
whether they may not be reached through their consequences. Now 
modus ponens, inferring the truth of a cognition from the truth of its 
consequences, would be allowed only if all of the possible consequences 
are true; for in this case only a single ground of this is possible, which 
is therefore also the true one.24 But this procedure is unusable, because 
to have insight into all possible consequences of any proposition that is 
assumed exceeds our powers; yet one uses this kind of inference, though 
to be sure with a certain degree of care, if it is merely a matter of proving 
something as an hypothesis, since there an inference by analogy is 
allowed: that, namely, if as many consequences as one has tested agree 
with an assumed ground then all other possible ones will also agree with 
it. But for this reason an hypothesis can never be transformed into a A79I/Bo8I9 
demonstrated truth by this path. The modus tollens of rational inferences,
a which infers from the consequences to the grounds, proves not 
only entirely strictly but also in all cases easily. For if even only a single 
false consequence can be derived from a proposition, then this proposition 
is false.25 Now instead of having to run through the entire series 
of the grounds in an ostensive proof that can lead to the truth of a cognition, 
by means of complete insight into its possibility, one need only 
find a single false one among the consequences flowing from its contrary, 
and then the contrary is also false, thus the cognition that one had 
to prove is true. 
Apagogic proof, however, can be allowed only in those sciences 
where it is impossible to substitutethat which is subjective in our representations 
for that which is objective, namely the cognition of what is 
in the object. Where the latter is the dominant concern, however, then 
it must frequently transpire that the opposite of a certain proposition 
either simply contradicts the subjective conditions of thought but not 
the object, or else that both propositions contradict each other only 
under a subjective condition that is falsely held to be objective, and that 
since the condition is false, both of them can be false, without it being 
possible to infer the truth of one from the falsehood of the other.

A792/ B 820 In mathematics this subreption is impossible; hence apagogic proof 
has its proper place there. In natural science, since everything there is 
grounded on empirical intuitions, such false pretenses can frequently be 
guarded against through the comparison of many observations; but this 
kind of proof itself is for the most part unimportant in this area. The 
transcendental attempts of pure reason, however, are all conducted 
within the real medium of dialectical illusion, i.e., the subjective which 
offers itself to or even forces itself upon reason as objective in its 
premises. Now here it simply cannot be allowed that assertions of 
synthetic propositions be justified by the refutation of their opposites. 
For either this refutation is nothing other than the mere representation 
of the conflict of the opposed opinion with the subjective conditions of 
comprehensibility through our reason, which does nothing by way of 
rejecting the thing itself (just as, e.g., unconditional necessity in the existence 
of a being cannot be conceived by us at all, and hence every 
speculative proof of a necessary highest being is therefore rightfully opposed 
subjectively, but the possibility of such an original being in itselfis 
not rightfully opposed), or else both, the affirmative as well as the 
negative part, taken in by transcendental illusion, have as their ground 

A793o/ B 82 I an impossible concept of the object, and then the rule holds that non 
entis nulla sunt predicata,a i.e., both what one asserts affirmatively as well 
as what one asserts negatively of the object are incorrect, and one cannot 
arrive at cognition of the truth apagogically through the refutation 
of its opposite. So, for example, if it is presupposed that the sensible 
world is given in its totality in itself, then it is false that it must be either 
infinite in space orb finite and bounded, just because both of these 
are false. For appearances (as mere representations), which would yet be 
given in themselves (as objects), are something impossible, and the infinity 
of this imagined whole would, to be sure, be unconditioned, but 
would nevertheless (since everything in appearances is conditioned) 
contradict the unconditioned determination of magnitude that is presupposed 
in the concept. 
Apagogic proof is also the real deception with which the admirers of 
the thoroughness of our dogmatic sophists have always been held off; it 
is the champion, as it were, who would prove the honor and the indisputable 
right of his chosen party by his pledge to take on anyone who 
would doubt it, although through such boasting nothing is settled about 
the real issue but only the relative strength of the opponents, and indeed 
only that of the one who is on the attack. The observers, seeing

them: non defensoribus istis tempus eget. b Each must conduct his affair by 
means of a legitimate proof through the transcendental deduction of its 
grounds of proof, i.e., directly, so that one can see what his claim of 
reason has to say for itself. For if his opponent stands on subjective 
grounds, it is of course easy to refute him, but without any advantage to 
the dogmatist, who commonly depends in just the same way on subjective 
causes of judgment and who can in the same way be driven into a 
corner by his opponent. But if both sides would only proceed directly, 
then either they themselves must notice the difficulty, indeed the impossibility 
of discovering a title for their assertions, and will in the end 
be able to appeal only to their antiquity, or else the critique will easily 
reveal the dogmatic illusion, and compel pure reason to surrender its 
exaggerated pretensions in its speculative use, and to draw back within 
the boundaries of its proper territory, namely practical principles.

The Transcendental Doctrine of Method 
Second Chapter 
The canon of pure reason 
It is humiliating for human reason that it accomplishes nothing in its 
pure use, and even requires a discipline to check its extravagances and 
avoid the deceptions that come from them. But, on the other side, that 
reason can and must exercise this discipline itself, without allowing anything 
else to censor it, elevates it and gives it confidence in itself, for the 
boundaries that it is required to set for its speculative use at the same 
time limit the sophistical pretensions of every opponent, and thus it can 
secure against all attacks everything that may still be left to it from its 
previously exaggerated demands. The greatest and perhaps only utility 
of all philosophy of pure reason is thus only negative, namely that it 
does not serve for expansion, as an organon, but rather, as a discipline, 
serves for the determination of boundaries, and instead of discovering 
truth it has only the silent merit of guarding against errors. 


Nevertheless, there must somewhere be a source of positive cognitions 
that belong in the domain of pure reason, and that perhaps give 

A796/ B 824 occasion for errors only through misunderstanding, but that in fact 
constitute the goal of the strenuous effort of reason. For to what cause 
should the unquenchable desire to find a firm footing beyond all 
bounds of experience otherwise be ascribed? Pure reason has a presentiment 
of objects of great interest to it. It takes the path of mere speculation 
in order to come closer to these; but they flee before it. 
Presumably it may hope for better luck on the only path that still remains 
to it, namely that of its practical use. 
r understand by a canon the sum total of the apriori principles of the 
correct use of certain cognitive faculties in general. Thus general logic 
in its analytical part is a canon for understanding and reason in general, 
but only as far as form is concerned, since it abstracts from all content. 
Thus the transcendental analytic was the canon of the pure understanding;
for it alone is capable of true synthetic apriori cognitions. But 
where no correct use of a cognitive power is possible there is no canon. 
Now according to the proofs that have previously been given, allosynthetic 
cognition of pure reason in its speculative use is entirely impos

might be able to have insight into the spiritual nature of the soul (and 
with that into its immortality), yet that cannot be counted on either as 
an explanatory ground of the appearances in this life or for the special 

A799/ B 827 constitution of the future state, because our concept of an incorporeal 
nature is merely negative, and does not in the least expand our cognition 
nor offer any suitable material for any conclusions except merely 
fictional ones, which cannot be sanctioned by philosophy. Third, even 
if the existence of a highest intelligence were proved, we would, to be 
sure, be able to make that which is purposive in the arrangement and 
order of the world comprehensible in general, but would by no means 
be authorized to derive from it any particular arrangement and order, 
or boldly to infer one where it is not perceived, for it is a necessary rule 
of the speculative use of reason not to bypass natural causes and abandon 
that about which we could be instructed by experience in order to 
derive something that we know from something that entirely surpasses 
all our knowledge. n In a word, these three propositions always remain 
transcendent for speculative reason, and have no immanent use, i.e., 
one that is permissible for objects of experience and therefore useful for 
us in some way, but are rather, considered in themselves, entirely idle 
even though extremely difficult efforts of our reason. 

If, then, these three cardinal propositions are not at all necessary for 
our knowing, and yet are insistently recommended to us by our reason, 
A800 / B828 their importance must really concern only the practical. 

Everything is practical that is possible through freedom. But if the 
conditions for the exercise of our free choiceb are empirical, then in that 
case reason can have none but a regulative use, and can only serve to 
produce the unity of empirical laws, as, e.g., in the doctrine of prudence 
the unification of all ends that are given to us by our inclinations into 
the single end of happiness and the harmony of the means for attaining 
that end constitute the entire business of reason, which can therefore 
provide none but pragmaticlaws of free conduct for reaching the 
ends recommended to us by the senses, and therefore can provide no 
pure laws that are determined completely a priori. Pure practical laws, 
on the contrary, whose end is given by reason completely a priori, and 
which do not command under empirical conditions but absolutely, 
would be products of pure reason. Of this sort, however, are the moral 
laws; thus these alone belong to the practical use of reason and permit 
a canon. 


Thus the entire armament of reason, in the undertaking that one can 
call pure philosophy, is in fact directed only at the three problems that 
have been mentioned. These themselves, however, have in turn their

On the ultimate end of pure reason 

more remote aim, namely, what is to be done if the will is free, if there 
is a God, and if there is a future world. Now since these concern our 
conduct in relation to the highest end, the ultimate aim of nature which A80I IB 829 
provides for us wisely in the disposition of reason is properly directed 
only to what is moral. 

However, since we now cast our attention upon an object that is foreign* 
to transcendental philosophy, caution is necessary in order not to 
digress into episodes and injure the unity of the same system, but on the 
other side also in order not to say too little about the new material, thus 
allowing it to fail in clarity or conviction. I hope to achieve both by 
keeping as close as possible to the transcendental and setting aside entirely 
what might here be psychological, i.e., empirical. 

And here the first thing to note is that for the present I will use the 
concept of freedom only in a practical senseO and set aside, as having 
been dealt with above, the transcendental signification of the concept, 
which cannot be empirically presupposed as an explanatory ground of A802lB830 
the appearances but is rather itself a problem for reason.27 A faculty of 
choice, that is, is merely animal (arbitrium brutum) which cannot be determined 
other than through sensible impulses, i.e., pathologically. 
However, one which can be determined independently of sensory impulses, 
thus through motivesb that can only be represented by reason, is 
called free choice (arbitrium liberum), and everything that is connected 
with this, whether as ground or consequence, is called practical. 
Practical freedom can be proved through experience. For it is not merely 
that which stimulates the senses, i.e., immediately affects them, that determines 
human choice, but we have a capacityc to overcome impressions 
on our sensory faculty of desire by representations of that which is 
useful or injurious even in a more remote way; but these considerations 
about that which in regard to our whole condition is desirable, i.e., good 
and useful, depend on reason. Hence this also yields laws that are imperatives, 
i.e., objective laws of freedom, and that say what ought to 
happen,even though perhaps it never does happen, and that are thereby

of pleasure or displeasure, and thus, at least indirectly, to objects of our feeling. 
But since this is not a power for the representation of things, but lies outside 
the cognitive power altogether, the elements of our judgments, insofar as 
they are related to pleasure or displeasure, thus belong to practical philososolely 
with pure a priori cognitions.

distinguished from laws of nature, which deal only with that which 
does happen, on which account the former are also called practical laws. 
A803/B83I But whether in these actions, through which it prescribes laws, reason 
is not itself determined by further influences, and whether that 
which with respect to sensory impulses is called freedom might not in 
turn with regard to higher and more remote efficient causes be nature 
-in the practical sphere this does not concern us, since in the first 
instance we ask of reason only a precept for conduct; it is rather a 
merely speculative question, which we can set aside as long as our aim 
is directed to action or omission.a We thus cognize practical freedom 
through experience, as one of the natural causes, namely a causality of 
reason in the determination of the will, whereas transcendental freedom 
requires an independence of this reason itself (with regard to its 
causality for initiating a series of appearances) from all determining 
causes of the world of the senses, and to this extent seems to be contrary 
to the law of nature, thus to all possible experience, and so remains 
a problem. Yet this problem does not belong to reason in its 
practical use, so in a canon of pure reason we are concerned with only 
two questions that pertain to the practical interest of pure reason, and 
with regard to which a canon of its use must be possible, namely: Is 
there a God? Is there a future life? The question about transcendental 
freedom concerns merely speculative knowledge, which we can set 


A804/ B 832 aside as quite indifferent if we are concerned with what is practical, and 
about which there is already sufficient discussion in the Antinomy of 
Pure Reason.

On the ideal of the highest good, 
as a determining ground 
of the ultimate end of pure reason. 

In its speculative use reason led us through the field of experiences, and, 
since it could never find complete satisfaction for itself there, it led us 
on from there to speculative ideas, which in the end, however, led us 
back again to experience, and thus fulfilled its aim in a way that is quite 
useful but not quite in accord with our expectation. Now yet another 
experiment remains open to us: namely, whether pure reason is also to 
be found in practical use, whether in that use it leads us to the ideas that 
attain the highest ends of pure reason which we have just adduced, and 
thus whether from the point of view of its practical interest reason may

not be able to guarantee that which in regard to its speculative interest 
it entirely refuses to us. 
All interest of my reason (the speculative as well as the practical) is 
united in the following three questions: 

1.What can I know? A8oSlBo833 
2. What should I do? 
3. What may I hope? 
The first question is merely speculative. We have (as I flatter myself) 
already exhausted all possible replies to it, and finally found that with 
which reason must certainly satisfy itself and with which, if it does not 
look to the practical, it also has cause to be content; but from the two 
great ends to which this entire effort of pure reason was really directed 
we remain just as distant as if, out of a concern for comfort, we had declined 
this labor at the outset. If, therefore, the issue is knowledge, then 
this much at least is certain and settled, that we can never partake of 
knowledge with respect to those two problems. 

The second question is merely practical. As such, to be sure, it can 
belong to pure reason, but in that case it is not transcendental, but 
moral, and thus it cannot be in itself a subject for our critique. 

The third question, namely, "If I do what I should, what may I then 
hope?" is simultaneously practical and theoretical, so that the practical 
leads like a clue to a reply to the theoretical question and, in its highest 
form, the speculative question. For all hope concerns happiness, and 
with respect to the practical and the moral law it is the very same as 
what knowledge and the natural law is with regard to theoretical cognition 
of things. The former finally comes down to the inference that A8061B834 
something is(which determines the ultimate final end) because something 
ought to happen; the latter, that something is (which acts as the 
supreme cause) because something does happen. 

Happiness is the satisfaction of all of our inclinations (extensive,a with 
regard to their manifoldness, as well as intensive,b with regard to degree, 
andc also protensive, dwith regard to duration). The practical law from 
the motive of happiness I call pragmatic (rule of prudence); but that 
which is such that it has no other motive than the worthiness to be 
happy I call moral (moral law)! The first advises us what to do if we 
want to partake of happiness; the second commands how we should behave 
in order even to be worthy of happiness. The first is grounded on 

a extensively 
b intensively

empirical principles;a for except by means of experience r can know neither 
which inclinations there are that would be satisfied nor what the 
natural causes are that could satisfy them. The second abstracts from 
inclinations and natural means of satisfying them, and considers only 
the freedom of a rational being in general and the necessary conditions 
under which alone jr is in agreement with the distribution of happiness 
in accordance with principles/ and thus it at least canrest on mere ideas 
of pure reason and be cognized apriori. 

A807/B 835 r assume that there are really pure moral laws, which determine completely 
apriori (without regard to empirical motives, i.e., happiness) the 
action and omission, i.e., the use of the freedom of a rational being in 
general, and that these laws command absolutely (not merely hypothetically 
under the presupposition of other empirical ends), and are 
thus necessary in every respect.28 r can legitimately presuppose this 
proposition by appealing not only to the proofs of the most enlightened 
moralists but also to the moral judgment of every human being, if he 
will distinctly think such a law. 
Pure reason thus contains -not in its speculative use, to be sure, but 
yet in a certain practical use, namely the moral use -principles C of the 
possibility of experience, namely of those actions in conformity with 
moral precepts which could be encountered in the history of humankind. 
For since they command that these actions ought to happen, 
they must also be able to happen, and there must therefore be possible 
a special kind of systematic unity, namely the moral, whereas the systematic 
unity of nature in accordance with speculative principlesd of 
reason could not be proved, since reason has causality with regard to 
freedom in general but not with regard to the whole of nature, and 
moral principles of reasone can produce free actions but not laws of na


A808/B 836 ture. Thus the principles! of pure reason have objective reality in their 
practical use, that is, in the moral use. 
r call the world as it would be if it were in conformity with all moral 
laws (as it canbe in accordance with the freedomof rational beings and 
should be in accordance with the necessary laws of morality) a moral 
world.gThis is conceived thus far merely as an intelligible world, since 
abstraction is made therein from all conditions (ends) and even from all 
hindrances to morality in it (weakness or impurityh of human nature).

Thus far it is therefore a mere, yet practical, idea, which really can and 
should have its influence on the sensible world, in order to make it 
agree as far as possible with this idea. The idea of a moral world thus 
has objective reality, not as if it pertained to an object of an intelligible 
intuition (for we cannot even think of such a thing), but as pertaining 
to the sensible world, although as an object of pure reason in its practical 
use and a corpus mysticum of the rational beings in it, insofar as their 
free choice under moral laws has thoroughgoing systematic unity in itself 
as well as with the freedom of everyone else. 

This was the reply to the first of the two questions of pure reason that 
concern the practical interest: Do that through which you will become 
worthy to be happy. Now the second question asks: Now if! be-A809/B 837 
have so as not to be unworthy of happiness, how may I hope thereby to 
partake of it? For the answer to this question, the issue is whether the 
principlesa of pure reason that prescribe the law a priori also necessarily 
connect this hope with it. 

I say, accordingly, that just as the moral principlesb are necessary in 
accordance with reason in its practicaluse, it is equally necessary to assume 
in accordance with reason in its theoreticaluse' that everyone has 
cause to hope for happiness in the same measure as he has made himself 
worthy of it in his conduct, and that the system of morality is therefore 
inseparably combined with the system of happiness, though only in 
the idea of pure reason. 

Now in an intelligible world, i.e., in the moral world, in the concept 
of which we have abstracted from all hindrances to morality (of the inclinations)' 
such a system of happiness proportionately combined with 
morality can also be thought as necessary, since freedom, partly moved 
and partly restricted by moral laws, would itself be the cause of the general 
happiness, and rational beings, under the guidance of such principles,
d would themselves be the authors of their own enduring welfare 
and at the same time that of others. But this system of self-rewarding 
morality is only an idea, the realization of which rests on the condition A8IO/ B 838 
that everyone do what he should, i.e., that all actions of rational beings 
occur as if they arose from a highest will that comprehends all private 
choice in or under itself. But since the obligation from the moral law 
remains valid for each particular use of freedom even if others do not 
conduct themselves in accord with this law, how their consequences will 
be related to happiness is determined neither by the nature of the things 
in the world, nor by the causality of actions themselves and their rela

tiona to morality; and the necessary connection of the hope of being 
happy with the unremitting effort to make oneself worthy of happiness 
that has been adduced cannot be cognized through reason if it is 
grounded merely in nature, but may be hoped for only if it is at the 
same time grounded on a highest reason, which commands in accordance 
with moral laws, as at the same time the cause of nature. 

I call the idea of such an intelligence, in which the morally most perfect 
will, combined with the highest blessedness, is the cause of all happiness 
in the world, insofar as it stands in exact relationb with morality 
(as the worthiness to be happy), the ideal of the highest good. 29 Thus 
only in the ideal of the highest original good can pure reason find the 
ground of the practically necessary connection of both elements of the 


ASII/B839 highest derived good, namely of an intelligible, i.e., moralworld. Now 
since we must necessarily represent ourselves through reason as belonging 
to such a world, although the senses do not present us with anything 
except a world of appearances, we must assume the moral world 
to be a consequence of our conduct in the sensible world; and since the 
latter does not offer such a connection to us, we must assume the former 
to be a world that is future for us. Thus God and a future life are 
two presuppositions that are not to be separated from the obligation 
that pure reason imposes on us in accordance with principles' of that 
very same reason. 
Morality in itself constitutes a system, but happiness does not, except 
insofar as it is distributed precisely in accordance with morality. This, 
however, is possible only in the intelligible world, under a wise author 
and regent. Reason sees itself as compelled either to assume such a 
thing, together with life in such a world, which we must regard as a future 
one, or else to regard the moral laws as empty figments of the 
brain, since without that presupposition their necessary success, which 
the same reason connects with them, would have to disappear. Hence 
everyone also regards the moral laws as commands, which, however, 
they could not be if they did not connect appropriate consequences 
with their rule apriori, and thus carry with them promisesand threats. 

A812/ B 840 This, however, they could not do if they did not lie in a necessary being, 
as the highest good, which alone can make possible such a purposive 
unity. 
Leibniz called the world, insofar as in it one attends only to rational 
beings and their interconnection in accordance with moral laws under 
the rule of the highest good, the realm30 of grace, and distinguished 
it from the realm of nature, where, to be sure, rational beings stand

On the ideal of the highest good 
under moral laws but cannot expect any successes for their conduct except 
in accordance with the course of nature in our sensible worldY 
Thus to regard ourselves as in the realm of grace, where every happiness 
awaits us as long as we do not ourselves limit our share of it 
through the unworthiness to be happy, is a practically necessary idea of 
reason. 
Practical laws, insofar as they are at the same time subjective grounds 
of actions, i.e., subjective principles, are called maxims. The judgmenta 
of morality concerning its purity and consequences takes place 
in accordance with ideas, the observance of its laws, in accordance 
with maximsY 
It is necessary that our entire course of life be subordinated to moral 
maxims; but it would at the same time be impossible for this to happen 
if reason did not connect with the moral law, which is a mere idea, an 
efficient cause which determines for the conduct in accord with this law 
an outcome precisely corresponding to our highest ends, whether in 
this or in another life. Thus without a God and a world that is now not A 8 1 3/B 841 
visible to us but is hoped for, the majestic ideas of morality are, to be 
sure, objects of approbation and admiration but not incentives for resolve 
and realization, because they would not fulfill the whole end that 
is natural for every rational being and determined apriori and necessarily 
through the very same pure reason. 
Happiness alone is far from the complete good for our reason. Reason 
does not approve of it (however much inclination may wish for it) 
where it is not united with the worthiness to be happy, i.e., with morally 
good conduct. Yet morality alone, and with it, the mere worthiness to 
be happy, is also far from being the complete good. In order to complete 
the latter, he who has not conducted himself so as to be unworthy 
of happiness must be able to hope to partake of it. Even reason free 
from all private aims cannot judge otherwise if, without taking into account 
an interest of its own, it puts itself in the place of a being who 
would have to distribute all happiness to others; for in the practical idea 
both elements are essentially combined, though in such a way that the 
moral disposition, as a condition, first makes partaking in happiness 
possible, rather than the prospect of happiness first making possible the 
moral disposition. For in the latter case the disposition would not be 
moral and would therefore also be unworthy of complete happiness, A814/B842 
which knowsb no other limitation before reason except that which is derived 
from our own immoral conduct. 
Thus happiness in exact proportion with the morality of rational beings, 
through which they are worthy of it, alone constitutes the highest

good of a world into which we must without exception transpose ourselves 
in accordance with the precepts of pure but practical reason, and 
which, of course, is only an intelligible world, since the sensible world 
does not promise us that sort of systematic unity of ends, the reality of 
which can be grounded on nothing other than the presupposition of a 
highest original good, since self-sufficient reason, armed with all of the 
sufficiency of a supreme cause, in accordance with the most perfect purposiveness, 
grounds, conserves, and completes the order of things that 
is universal though well hidden from us in the sensible world. 

Now this moral theology has the peculiar advantage over the speculative 
one that it inexorably leads to the concept of a single, most perfect, 
and rational primordial being, of which speculative theology 
could not on objective grounds give us even a hint, let alone convince 
us. For neither in speculative nor in natural theology, as far as reason 
may lead us, do we find even a single significant ground for assuming a 

A815/B843 singlea being to set before all natural causes, on which we would at the 
same time have sufficient cause to make the latter dependent in every 
way. On the contrary, if, from the standpoint of moral unity, we assess 
the cause that can alone provide this with the appropriate effecrl' and 
thus obligating force for us, as a necessary law of the world, then there 
must be a single supreme will, which comprehends all these laws in itself. 
For how would we find complete unity of purposes among different 
wills? This will must be omnipotent, so that all of nature and its 
relation to morality in the world are subject to it; omniscient, so that it 
cognizes the inmost dispositions and their moral worth; omnipresent, 
so that it is immediately ready for every need that is demanded by the 
highest good for the world; eternal, so that this agreement of nature 
and freedom is not lacking at any time, etc. 
But this systematic unity of ends in this world of intelligences, which, 
though as mere nature it can only be called the sensible world, as a system 
of freedom can be called an intelligible, i.e., moral world (regnum 
gratiae),c also leads inexorably to the purposive unity of all things that 
constitute this great whole, in accordance with universal laws of nature, 
just as the first does in accordance with universal and necessary moral 
laws, and unifies practical with speculative reason. The world must be 

ASI6/ B 844 represented as having arisen out of an idea if it is to be in agreement 
with that use of reason without which we would hold ourselves unworthy 
of reason, namely the moral use, which depends throughout on the 
idea of the highest good. All research into nature is thereby directed toward 
the form of a system of ends, and becomes, in its fullest extension,

physico-theology. This, however, since it arises from moral order as a 
unity which is grounded in the essence of freedom and not contingently 
founded through external commands, brings the purposiveness of nature 
down to grounds that must be inseparably connected apriori to the 
inner possibility of things, and thereby leads to a transcendental theology 
that takes the ideal of the highest ontological perfection as a 
principlea of systematic unity, which connects all things in accordance 
with universal and necessary laws of nature, since they all have their origin 
in the absolute necessity of a single original being. 
What sort of use can we make of our understanding, even in regard 
to experience, if we do not set ends before ourselves? The highest 
ends, however, are those of morality, and only pure reason can grant us 
cognition of these. But though equipped and guided with these, we still 
cannot even make any purposive use of our acquaintanceb with nature 
for cognitionc unless nature itself has introduced purposive unity; for A 8 171 B 845 
without this we would not even have any reason, since we would have 
no school for it and no culture through objects that would offer the 
material for such concepts. That purposive unity is necessary, however, 
and grounded in the essence of the faculty of choice itself, and therefore 
this one, which contains the condition of the application of that 
unity in concreto, must also be necessary, and thus the transcendental 
improvement of our rational cognition is not the cause but rather 
merely the effect of the practical purposiveness which pure reason imposes 
on us. 
Hence we also find in the history of human reason that before the 
moral concepts were adequately purified and determined and the systematic 
unity of purposes was understood in accordance with them and 
from necessary principles,d the knowledge of nature and even a considerable 
degree of culture of reason in many other sciences could, on the 
one hand, produce only rudimentary and vague concepts of the deity, 
and, on the other, leave a remarkable indifference with regard to this 
question in general. A greater refinement of moral ideas, which was 
made necessary by the extremely pure moral law of our religion, made 
reason attend more sharply to its object by means of the interest that it 
required reason to take in this object, and, without a contribution from 
either more ample acquaintance with nature or correct and reliable 
transcendental insights (which have been lacking at all times), produced ASIS/BS46 
a concept of the divine being that we now hold to be correct, not because 
speculative reason convinces us of its correctness but because it is 
a Princip

in perfect agreement with the moral principles of reason.a And thus, in 
the end, only pure reason, although only in its practical use, always has 
the merit of connecting with our highest interest a cognition that mere 
speculation can only imagine but never make valid, and of thereby making 
it into not a demonstrated dogma but yet an absolutely necessary 
presupposition for reasono's most essential ends. 

But now when practical reason has attained this high point, namely 
the concept of a single original being as the highest good, it must not 
undertake to start out from this concept and derive the moral laws 
themselves from it, as if it had elevated itself above all empirical conditions 
of its application and soared up to an immediate acquaintance with 
new objects. For it was these laws alone whose inner practical necessity 
led us to the presupposition of a self-sufficient cause or a wise worldregent, 
in order to give effectb to these laws, and hence we cannot in 
turn regard these as contingent and derived from a mere will, especially 


A819/B847 from a will of which we would have had no concept at all had we not 
formed it in accordance with those laws.33 So far as practical reason has 
the right to lead us, we will not hold actions to be obligatory because 
they are God's commands, but will rather regard them as divine commands 
because we are internally obligated to them.34 We will study freedom 
under the purposive unity in accordance with principlesc of reason, 
and will believe ourselves to be in conformity with the divine will only 
insofar as we hold as holy the moral law that reason teaches us from the 
nature of actions themselves, believing ourselves to serve this divine will 
only through furthering what is best for the worldd in ourselves and others. 
Moral theology is therefore only of immanent use, namely for fulfilling 
our vocation here in the world by fitting into the system of all 
ends, not for fanatically or even impiously abandoning the guidance of 
a morally legislative reason in the good course of life in order to connect 
it immediately to the idea of the highest being, which would provide 
a transcendental use but which even so, like the use of mere 
speculation, must pervert and frustrate the ultimate ends of reason.

he has reason, then its ground is objectively sufficient, and in that case 
taking something to be true is called conviction.a If it has its ground only 
in the particular constitution of the subject, then it is called persuasion.b 
Persuasion is a mere semblance,c since the ground of the judgment, 
which lies solely in the subject, is held to be objective. Hence such a 
judgment also has only private validity, and this taking something to be 
true cannot be communicated. Truth, however, rests upon agreement 
with the object, dwith regard to which, consequently, the judgments of 
every understanding must agree (consentientia uni tertio, consentiunt inter 
se).e The touchstone of whether taking something to be true is conviction 
or mere persuasion is therefore, externally, the possibility of communicating 
it and finding it to be valid for the reason of every human 
being to take it to be true; for in that case there is at least a presumption 
that the ground of the agreement of all judgments, regardless of A82 I / B 849 
the difference among the subjects, rests on the common ground, 
namely the object/ with which they therefore all agree and through 
which the truth of the judgment is proved. 
Accordingly, persuasion cannot be distinguished from conviction 
subjectively, when the subject has taken something to be true merely as 
an appearance of his own mind; but the experiment that one makes on 
the understanding of others, to see if the grounds that are valid for us 
have the same effect on the reason of others, is a means, though only a 
subjective one, not for producing conviction, to be sure, but yet for revealing

that is mere persuasion. 
If, moreover, one can unfold the subjective causes of the judgment, 
which we take to be objective grounds for it, and thus explain taking 
something to be true deceptively as an occurrence in our mind, without 
having any need for the constitution of the object, g then we expose the 
illusion and are no longer taken in by it, although we are always 
tempted to a certain degree if the subjective cause of the illusion depends 
upon our nature. 
I cannot assert anything, i.e., pronounce it to be a judgment necessarily 
valid for everyone, except that which produces conviction. I can A822/Bo8S0

not want to make it valid beyond myself.

Doctrine of Method. Ch. II. Sec. III 

Taking something to be true, or the subjective validity of judgment, 
has the following three stages in relation to conviction (which at the 
same time is valid objectively): having an opinion, believing, and 
knowing. Having an opinionis taking something to be true with the 
consciousness that it is subjectively as well as objectively insufficient. If 
taking something to be true is only subjectively sufficient and is at the 
same time held to be objectively insufficient, then it is called believing. 
Finally, when taking something to be true is both subjectively and objectively 
sufficient it is called knowing. Subjective sufficiency is called 
conviction (for myself), objective sufficiency, certainty (for everyone). 
I will not pause for the exposition of such readily grasped concepts. 

I must never undertake to have an opinion without at least knowingsomething 
by means of which the in itself merely problematic judgment 
acquires a connection with truth which, although it is not 
complete, is nevertheless more than an arbitrary invention. Furthermore, 
the law of such a connection must be certain. For if in regard to 
this too I have nothing but opinion, then it is all only a game of imagination 
without the least relation to truth. In judging from pure reason, 
to have an opinion is not allowed at all. For since it will not be sup


A823 / B 85 I ported on grounds of experience, but everything that is necessary 
should be cognized a priori, the principle of connection requires universality 
and necessity, thus complete certainty, otherwise no guidance 
to the truth is forthcoming at all. Hence it is absurd to have an opinion 
in pure mathematics: one must know, or else refrain from all judgment. 
It is just the same with the principles of morality, since one must not 
venture an action on the mere opinion that something is allowed, but 
must know this. 

In the transcendental use of reason, on the contrary, to have an opinion 
is of course too little, but to know is also too much. In a merely 
speculative regard, therefore, we cannot judge at all here, for subjective 
grounds for taking something to be true, such as those that can produce 
belief, deserve no approval in speculative questions, where they neither 
remain free of all empirical assistance nor allow of being communicated 
to others in equal measure. 


Only in a practical relation, however, can taking something that is 
theoretically insufficient to be true be called believing,36 This practical 
aim is either that of skill or of morality, the former for arbitrary and 
contingent ends, the latter, however, for absolutely necessary ends. 

Once an end is proposed, then the conditions for attaining it are hypothetically 
necessary. This necessity is subjectively but still only comA824/

everyone if I know with certainty that no one else can know of any other 
conditions that lead to the proposed end. In the first case my presupposition 
and taking certain conditions to be true is a merely contingent 
belief, in the second case, however, it is a necessary belief. The doctor 
must do something for a sick person who is in danger, but he does not 
knowa the illness. He looks to the symptoms/ and judges, because he 
does not know of anything better, that it is consumption. His belief is 
merely contingent even in his own judgment; someone else might perhaps 
do better. I call such contingent beliefs, which however ground the 
actual use of the means to certain actions, pragmatic beliefs. 

The usual touchstone of whether what someone asserts is mere persuasion 
or at least subjective conviction, i.e., firm belief, is betting. 
Often someone pronounces his propositions with such confident and 
inflexible defiance that he seems to have entirely laid aside all concern 
for error. A bet disconcerts him. Sometimes he reveals that he is persuaded 
enough for one ducat but not for ten. For he would happily bet 
one, but at ten he suddenly becomes aware of what he had not previ-A82S/B8S3 
ously noticed, namely that it is quite possible that he has erred. If we 
entertain the thought that we should wager the happiness of our whole 
life on something, our triumphant judgment would quickly disappear, 
we would become timid and we would suddenly discover that our belief 
does not extend so far,37 Thus pragmatic belief has only a degree, which 
can be large or small according to the difference of the interest that is 
at stake. 

Since, however, even though we might not be able to undertake anything 
in relation to an object,c and taking something to be true is therefore 
merely theoretical, in many cases we can still conceive and imagine 
an undertaking for which we would suppose ourselves to have sufficient 
grounds if there were a means for arriving at certainty about the matter; 
thus there is in merely theoretical judgments an analogue of practical 
judgments, where taking them to be true is aptly described by the 
word belief, and which we can call doctrinal beliefs.d If it were possible 
to settle by any sort of experience whether there are inhabitants of 
at least some of the planets that we see, I might well bet everything that 
I have on it. Hence I say that it is not merely an opinion but a strong 
belief (on the correctness of which I would wager many advantages in 
life) that there are also inhabitants of other worlds.

Doctrine of Method. Ch. II. Sec. III 

A826/B8S4 Now we must concede that the thesis of the existence of God belongs 
to doctrinal belief. For although with regard to theoretical knowledge 
of the world I have nothing at my command that necessarily presupposes 
this thought as the condition of my explanations of the appearances 
of the world, but am rather obliged to make use of my reason as 
if everything were mere nature, purposive unity is still so important a 
condition of the application of reason to nature that I cannot pass it by, 
especially since experience liberally supplies examples of it. But I know 
no other condition for this unity that could serve me as a clue for the 
investigation of nature except insofar as I presuppose that a highest intelligence 
has arranged everything in accordance with the wisest ends. 
Consequently, the presupposition of a wise author of the world is a condition 
of an aim which is, to be sure, contingent but yet not inconsiderable, 
namely that of having a guide for the investigation of nature. 
The outcome of my experiments also so often confirms the usefulness 


of this presupposition, and nothing can be decisively said against it, so 

that I would say too little if I called my taking it to be true merely having 
an opinion, but rather even in this theoretical relationa it can be said 
that I firmly believe in God; but in this case this belief must not strictly 
be called practical, but must be called a doctrinal belief, which the the


A827/B8SS ology of nature (physico-theology) must everywhere necessarily produce. 
In regard to this same wisdom, in respect of the magnificent 
equipment of human nature and the shortness of life which is so ill 
suited to it, there is likewise to be found sufficient ground for a doctrinal 
belief in the future life of the human soul. 

The expression of belief is in such cases an expression of modesty 
from an objective point of view, but at the same time of the firmness of 
confidence in a subjective one. If here too I would call merely theoretically 
taking something to be true only an hypothesis that I would be 
justified in assuming, I would thereby make myself liable for more of a 
concept of the constitution of a world-cause and of another world than 
I can really boast of; for of that which I even only assume as an hypothesis 
I must know at least enough of its properties so that I need invent 
not its concept but only its existence. The word "belief," however, 
concerns only the direction that an idea gives me and the subjective influence 
on the advancement of my actions of reason that holds me fast 
to it, even though I am not in a position to give an account of it from a 
speculative point of view. 


But there is something unstable about merely doctrinal belief; one is 
often put off from it by difficulties that come up in speculation, alA828/
B8S6 though, to be sure, one inexorably returns to it again. 
It is entirely otherwise in the case ofmoral belief. For there it is ab-

to all my insight there is possible only a single condition under which 
this end is consistent with all ends together and thereby has practical validity, 
namely, that there be a God and a future world; I also know with 
complete certainty that no one else knows of any other conditions that 
lead to this same unity of ends under the moral law. But since the moral 
precept is thus at the same time my maxim (as reason commands that it 
ought to be), I will inexorably believe in the existence of God and a future 
life, and I am sure that nothing can make these beliefs unstable, 
since my moral principles themselves, which I cannot renounce without 
becoming contemptible in my own eyes, would thereby be subverted.38 
In this way enough is left to us, even after the frustration of all the 
ambitious aims of a reason that wanders about beyond the boundaries 
of all experience, that we have cause to be satisfied with it from a practical 
point of view. Of course, no one will be able to boast that he knows 
that there is a God and a future life; for ifohe knows that, then he is pre-A829/B 857 
cisely the man I have long sought. All knowing (if it concerns an object 
of reason alone) can be communicated, and I would therefore also be 
able to hope to have my knowledge extended to such a wonderful de-
gree by his instruction. No, the conviction is not logical but moral 
certainty, and, since it depends on subjective grounds (of moral dispo-

etc., but rather "I am morally certain" etc. That is, the belief in a God 
and another world is so interwoven with my moral disposition that I am 
in as little danger of ever surrendering the former as I am worried that 
the latter can ever be torn away from me. 
The only reservation that is to be found here is that this rational belief 
is grounded on the presupposition of moral dispositions. If we depart 
from that, and assume someone who would be entirely indifferent 
in regard to moral questions, then the question that is propounded by

A830/B 858 no human being is free of all interest in these questions. For although 
he might be separated from the moral interest by the absence of all 
good dispositions, yet even in this case there is enough left to make him 
fear a divine existence and a future. For to this end nothing more is required 
than that he at least cannot pretend to any certainty that there 
is no such being and no future life, which would have to be proved 
through reason alone and thus apodictically since he would have to establish 
them to be impossible, which certainly no rational human can 
undertake to do. That would be a negative belief, which, to be sure, 
would not produce morality and good dispositions, but would still produce 
the analogue of them, namely it could powerfully restrain the outbreak 
of evil dispositions. 

But is that all, one will say, that pure reason accomplishes in opening 
up prospects beyond the bounds of experience? Nothing more than two 
articles of belief? This much common understanding could also have 

A83 I /B 859 accomplished without taking advice from the philosophers! 
I will not boast here of the merit that philosophy has on account of 
the laborious effort of its critique of human reason, supposing even that 
this should be found in the end to be merely negative, for something 
more about that will be forthcoming in the next section. But do you demand 
then that a cognition that pertains to all human beings should 
surpass common understanding and be revealed to you only by philosophers? 
The very thing that you criticize is the best confirmation of the 
correctness of the assertions that have been made hitherto, that is, that 
it reveals what one could not have foreseen in the beginning, namely 
that in what concerns all human beings without exception nature is not 
to be blamed for any partiality in the distribution of its gifts, and in regard 
to the essential ends of human nature even the highest philosophy 
cannot advance further than the guidance that nature has also conferred 
on the most common understanding.

The Transcendental Doctrine of Method 
Third Chapter 
The 
architectonic of pure reason 
By an architectonic I understand the art of systems. Since systematic 
unity is that which first makes ordinary cognition into science, i.e., 
makes a system out of a mere aggregate of it, architectonic is the doctrine 
of that which is scientific in our cognition in general, and therefore 
necessarily belongs to the doctrine of method. 

Under the government of reason our cognitions cannot at all constitute 
a rhapsody but must constitute a system, in which alone they can 
support and advance its essential ends. I understand by a system, however, 
the unity of the manifold cognitions under one idea. This is the 
rational concept of the form of a whole, insofar as through this the domain 
of the manifold as well as the position of the parts with respect to 
each other is determined a priori. The scientific rational concept thus 
contains the end and the form of the whole that is congruent with it. 
The unity of the end, to which all parts are related and in the idea of 
which they are also related to each other, allows the absence of any part 
to be noticed in our knowledge of the rest, and there can be no contingent 
addition or undetermined magnitude of perfection that does not A833/B861 
have its boundaries determined a priori. The whole is therefore articulated 
(articulatio) and not heaped together (coacervatio);a it can, to be 
sure, grow internally (per intus susceptionem)b but not externally (per appositionem),
c like an animal body, whose growth does not add a limb but 
rather makes each limb stronger and fitter for its end without any alteration 
of proportion. 

For its execution the idea needs a schema, i.e., an essential manifoldness 
and order of the parts determined a priori from the principled 
of the end. A schema that is not outlined in accordance with an idea,

i.e., from the chief end of reason, but empirically, in accordance with 
aims occurring contingently (whose number" one cannot know in advance), 
yields technicalunity, but that which arises only in consequence 
of an idea (where reason provides the ends a priori and does not await 
them empirically) grounds architectonic unity. \Vhat we call science, 
whose schema contains the outline (monogramma) and the division of 
the whole into members in conformity with the idea, i.e., a priori, cannot 
arise technically, from the similarity of the manifold or the contingent 
use of cognition in concreto for all sorts of arbitrary external ends, 
but arises architectonically, for the sake of its affinity and its derivation 
from a single supreme and inner end, which first makes possible the 

A834/B 862 whole; such a science must be distinguished from all others with certainty 
and in accordance with principles.b 

Nobody attempts to establish a science without grounding it on an 
idea. But in its elaboration the schema, indeed even the definition of the 
science which is given right at the outset, seldom corresponds to the 
idea; for this lies in reason like a seed, all of whose parts still lie very involuted 
and are hardly recognizable even under microscopic observation. 
For this reason sciences, since they have all been thought out from 
the viewpoint of a certain general interest, must not be explained and 
determined in accordance with the description given by their founder, 
but rather in accordance with the idea, grounded in reason itself, of the 
natural unity of the parts that have been brought together. For the 
founder and even his most recent successors often fumble around with 
an idea that they have not even made distinct to themselves and that 
therefore cannot determine the special content, the articulation (systematic 
unity) and boundaries of the science. 

It is too bad that it is first possible for us to glimpse the idea in a 
clearer light and to outline a whole architectonically, in accordance with 
the ends of reason, only after we have long collected relevant cognitions 
haphazardly' like building materials and worked through them techni


A835/ B 863 cally with only a hint from an idea lying hidden within us. The systems 
seem to have been formed, like maggots, by a generatio aequivoca39 from 
the mere confluence of aggregated concepts, garbled at first but complete 
in time, although they all had their schema, as the original seed, 
in the mere self-development of reason, and on that account are not 
merely each articulated for themselves in accordance with an idea but 
are rather all in turn purposively united with each other as members of 
a whole in a system of human cognition, and allow an architectonic to 
all human knowledge, which at the present time, since so much mater

The architectonic of pure reason 

ial has already been collected or can be taken from the ruins of collapsed 
older edifices, would not merely be possible but would not even 
be very difficult. We shall content ourselves here with the completion 
of our task, namely, merely outlining the architectonic of all cognition 
from pure reason, and begin only at the point where the general root 
of our cognitive power divides and branches out into two stems, one of 
which is reason. By "reason" I here understand, however, the entire 
higher faculty of cognition, and I therefore contrast the· rational to the 
empirical. 

If I abstract from all content of cognition, objectively considered, 
then all cognition, considered subjectively, is either historical or ratio-A836/B864 
nal. Historical cognition40 is cognitio ex datis,a rational cognition, however, 
cognitio ex principiis.b However a cognition may have been given 
originally, it is still historical for him who possesses it if he cognizes it 
only to the degree and extent that it has been given to him from elsewhere, 
whether it has been given to him through immediate experience 
or told to him or even given to him through instruction (general cognitions). 
Hence he who has properly learned a system of philosophy, 
e.g., the Wolffian system, although he has in his head all of the principles, 
explanations, and proofs together with the division of the entire 
theoretical edifice, and can count everything off on his fingers, still has 
nothing other than a complete historicalcognition of the Wolffian philosophy; 
he knows and judges only as much as has been given to him. If 
you dispute one of his definitions, he has no idea where to get another 
one. He has formed himself according to an alien reason, but the faculty 
of imitation is not that of generation, i.e., the cognition did not 
arise from reason for him, and although objectively it was certainly a 
rational cognition, subjectively it is still merely historical. He has 
grasped and preserved well, i.e., he has learned, and is a plaster cast of 
a living human being. Rational cognitions that are objectively so (i.e., 
could have arisen originally only out of the reason of human beings 
themselves), may also bear this name subjectively only if they have been 
drawn out of the universal sources of reason, from which critique, in-A837/B 865 
deed even the rejection of what has been learned, can also arise, i.e., 
from principles.c 

Now all rational cognition is either cognition from concepts or cognition 
from the construction of concepts; the former is called philosophical, 
the latter mathematical. I have already dealt with the inner 
difference between the two in the first chapter.4' A cognition can accordingly 
be objectively philosophical and yet subjectively historical, as 


a cognition from data, or from what is given.

is the case with most students and with all of those who never see beyond 
their school and remain students their whole lives. But it is 
strange that mathematical cognition, however one has learned it, can 
still count subjectively as rational cognition, and that the difference present 
in the case of philosophical cognition is not present in this case. 
The cause of this is that the sources of cognition on which alone the 
teacher can draw lie nowhere other than in the essential and genuine 
principlesa of reason, and consequently cannot be derived from anywhere 
else by the student, nor disputed in any way, precisely because 
reason is here used in concreto though nevertheless a priori, founded, that 
is, in pure and therefore error-free intuition, and excludes all deception 
and error.4" Among all rational sciences (a priori), therefore, only mathematics 
can be learned, never philosophy (except historically); rather, as 
far as reason is concerned, we can at best only learn to philosophize. 

A838/B866 Now the system of all philosophical cognition is philosophy. One 
must take this objectively if one understands by it the archetype for the 
assessmentb of all attempts to philosophize, which should serve to assess" 
each subjective philosophy, the structure of which is often so manifold 
and variable. In this way philosophy is a mere idea of a possible 
science, which is nowhere given in concreto, but which one seeks to approach 
in various ways until the only footpath, much overgrown by sensibility, 
is discovered, and the hitherto unsuccessful ectype, so far as it 
has been granted to humans, is made equal to the archetype. Until then 
one cannot learn any philosophy; for where is it, who has possession of 
it, and by what can it be recognized? One can only learn to philosophize, 
i.e., to exercise the talent of reason in prosecuting its general 
principlesd in certain experiments that come to hand, but always with 
the reservation of the right of reason to investigate the sources of these 
principles themselves and to confirm or reject them.43 

Until now, however, the concept of philosophye has been only a 
scholastic concept,! namely that of a system of cognition that is sought 
only as a science without having as its end anything more than the systematic 
unity of this knowledge, thus the logical perfection of cognition. 
But there is also a cosmopolitan conceptg (conceptus cosmicus) that 
has always grounded this term, especially when it is, as it were, personA839/
B867 ified and represented as an archetype in the ideal of the philosopher. 
From this point of view philosophy is the science of the relation of all

cognition to the essential ends of human reason (teleologia rationis humanae),
a and the philosopher is not an artist of reason but the legislator 
ofhuman reason. It would be very boastful to call oneself a philosopher 
in this senseb and to pretend to have equaled the archetype, which lies 
only in the idea. 
The mathematician, the naturalist, the logician are only artists of reason, 
however eminent the former may be in rational cognitions and 
however much progress the latter may have made in philosophical cognition. 
There is still a teacher in the ideal, who controls all of these and 
uses them as tools to advance the essential ends of human reason. Him 
alone we must call the philosopher; however, since he himself is still 
found nowhere, although the idea of his legislation is found in every 
human reason, we will confine ourselves to the latter and determine 
more precisely what philosophy, in accordance with this cosmopolitan 
concept,* prescribes for systematic unity from the standpoint of ends. A840/ B 868 
Essential ends are on this account not yet the highest, of which (in 
the complete systematic unity of reason) there can be only a single one. 
Hence they are either the final end,c or subalternate ends, which necessarily 
belong to the former as means. The former is nothing other than 
the entire vocation d of human beings, and the philosophy of it is called 
moral philosophy. On account of the preeminence which moral philosophy 
had over all other applications of reason, the ancients understood 
by the name of "philosopher" first and foremost the moralist, and even 
the outer appearance of self-control through reason still suffices today 
for calling someone a philosopher after a certain analogy, in spite of his 
limited knowledge. 
Now the legislation of human reason (philosophy) has two objects, 
nature and freedom, and thus contains the natural law as well as the 
moral law, initially in two separate systems but ultimately in a single 
philosophical system. The philosophy of nature pertains to everything 
that is; that of morals only to that which should be. 
All philosophy, however, is either cognition from pure reason or rational 
cognition from empirical principles.e The former is called pure 
philosophy, the latter empirical. 
* A cosmopolitan concept here means one that concerns that which necessarA839/

with scholastic concepts if it is regarded only as one of the skills for certain

cognition, and is called critique, or, second, the system of pure 
reason (science), the whole (true as well as apparent) philosophical cognition 
from pure reason in systematic interconnection, and is called 
metaphysics; this name can also be given to all of pure philosophy including 
the critique, in order to comprehend the investigation of everything 
that can ever be cognized a priori as well as the presentation of 
that which constitutes a system of pure philosophical cognitions of this 
kind, but in distinction from all empirical as well as mathematical use of 
reason. 
Metaphysics is divided into the metaphysics of the speculative and 
the practicaluse of pure reason, and is therefore either metaphysics of 
nature or metaphysics of morals. The former contains all rational 
principleso from mere concepts (hence with the exclusion of mathematics) 
for the theoretical cognition of all things; the latter, the principlesb 
which determine action and omission a priori and make them 
necessary. Now morality is the only lawfulness of actions which can be 
derived entirely a priori from principles. C Hence the metaphysics of 
morals is really the pure morality, which is not grounded on any an


A84z1B870 thropology (no empirical condition). The metaphysics of speculative 
reason is that which has customarily been called metaphysics in the 
narrower sense;d but insofar as the pure doctrine of morals nevertheless 
belongs to the special stem of human and indeed philosophical cognition 
from pure reason, we will retain this term for it, although we set 
it aside here as not now pertaining to our end. 
It is of the utmost importance to isolate cognitions that differ from 
one another in their species and origin, and carefully to avoid mixing 
them together with others with which they are usually connected in 
their use. What chemists do in analyzing materials, what mathematicians 
do in their pure theory of magnitude, the philosopher is even 
more obliged to do, so that he can securely determine the proper value 
and influence of the advantage that a special kind of cognition has 
over the aimless use of the understanding. Hence human reason has 
never been able to dispense with a metaphysics as long as it has thought, 
or rather reflected,e though it has never been able to present it in a manner 
sufficiently purified of everything foreign to it. The idea of such a 
science is just as old as speculative human reason; and what reason does

always disputing among themselves about the discoveries that each 
would like to have made on his own, have brought their science into 
contempt first among others and finally even among themselves. 

A 845 IB873 Thus all pure a priori cognition, by means of the special faculty of cognition 
in which alone it can have its seat, constitutes a special unity, and 
metaphysics is that philosophy which is to present that cognition in this 
systematic unity. Its speculative part, to which this name has been especially 
appropriated, namely that which we call metaphysics of nature 
and which considers everything insofar as it is (not that which ought to 
be) on the basis of a priori concepts, is divided in the following way.a 
Metaphysics in this narrower senseb consists of transcendental philosophyand 
the physiology of pure reason. The former considers only 
the understanding and reason itself in a system of all concepts and 
principles that are related to objects in general, without assuming objectsC 
that would be given (Ontologia); the latter considers nature, i.e., 
the sum total of given objects (whether they are given by the senses or, 
if one will, by another kind of intuition), and is therefore physiology 
(though only rationalis).46 Now, however, the use of reason in this rational 
consideration of nature is either physical or hyperphysical, or, 
better, either immanent or transcendent. The former pertains to nature 
so far as its cognition can be applied in experience (in concreto), the 
latter to that connection of the objects of experience which surpasses all 

A8461 B 874 experience. Hence this transcendent physiology has either an inner 
connection to its object or an outer one, both of which, however, go 
beyond possible experience; the former is the physiology of nature in its 
entirety, i.e., the transcendental cognition of the world, the latter 
that of the connection of nature in its entirety to a being beyond nature, 
i.e., the transcendental cognition of God.47 
Immanent physiology, on the contrary, considers nature as the sum 
total of all objects of the senses, thus considers it as it is given to us, but 
only in accordance with a priori conditions, under which it can be given 
to us in general. There are, however, only two sorts of objects for this. 

1. Those of outer sense, thus the sum total of these, corporeal nature. 
2. The object of inner sense, the soul, and, in accordance with the fundamental 
concepts of this in general, thinking nature. The metaa 
Inserted in Kant's copy of the first edition: 
"I would divide it in accordance with the classes of the categories, so that in each class 
thethird category, which contains the other two, yields the idea of the science: 
"1. General ontology [Allgemeine Wesenlehre]; 2. Theory of namre; 3. Cosmology [Weltwissenschaftl; 
4. Theology." (E CLXXXIIl, p. 54; 23:43). This is the last emendation Kant 
made in his copy of the first edition.

The architectonic of pure reason 

physics of corporeal nature is called physics, but, since it is to contain 
only the principles of its a priori cognition, rational physics. The metaphysics 
of thinking nature is called psychology, and because of the 
cause that has just been adduced only the rational cognition of this is 
here meant. 

Accordingly, the entire system of metaphysics consists of four main 
parts. I. Ontology. 2. Rational Physiology. 3. Rational Cosmology. 

4. Rational Theology. The second part, namely the doctrine of nature 
of pure reason, contains two divisions,ophysica rationalis* andopsychologia A847/Bo875 
rationalis.48 
The original idea of a philosophy of pure reason itself prescribes this 
division; it is therefore architectonic, in conformity with its essential 
ends, and not merely technical, in accordance with contingently perceived 
affinities and, as it were, established by good luck; and for that 
very reason it is unchangeable and legislative. However, there are several 
points here which could arouse reservations and weaken the conviction 
of its lawfulness. 

First, how can 1 expect an a priori cognition and thus a metaphysics 
of objects that are given to our senses, thus given a posteriori? And how 
is it possible to cognize the nature of things in accordance with apriori 
principlesa and to arrive at a rational physiology? The answer is: We A848/ B 876 
take from experience nothing more than what is necessary to give ourselves 
an object, b partly of outer and partly of inner sense. The former 
is accomplished through the mere concept of matter (impenetrable 
lifeless extension), the latter through the concept of a thinking being 
(in the empirically inner representation "1 think"). Otherwise, we must 
in the entire metaphysics of these objects abstain entirely from any empirical 
principles' that might add any sort of experience beyond the 
concept in order to judge something about these objects. 

* One should not think, indeed, that I understand by this what is commonly A 847/ B 875 
called physica generalis, which is more mathematics than philosophy of nature. 
For the metaphysics of nature abstracts entirely from mathematics, and has 
nowhere near as many ampliative insights to offer as the latter, yet it is still 
very important with regard to the critique of the pure cognition of understanding 
that is to be applied to nature in general; in its absence even mathematicians, 
depending on certain common but in fact metaphysical concepts, 
have without noticing it burdened the doctrine of nature with hypotheses that 
disappear in a critique of these principlesd without doing the least damage to 
the use of mathematics in this field (which is entirely indispensable).

Second: Once one gives up the hope of achieving anything useful a 
priori, where does that leave empirical psychology, which has always 
asserted its place in metaphysics, and from which one has expected such 
great enlightenment in our own times?49 I answer: It comes in where 
the proper (empirical) doctrine of nature must be put, namely on the 
side of applied philosophy, for which pure philosophy contains the a 
priori principles,a which must therefore be combined but never confused 
with the former. Empirical psychology must thus be entirely 
banned from metaphysics, and is already excluded by the idea of it. 
Nevertheless, in accord with the customary scholastic usage one must 
still concede it a little place (although only as an episode) in meta


A849/B 877 physics, and indeed from economic motives, since it is not yet rich 
enough to comprise a subject on its own and yet it is too important for 
one to expel it entirely or attach it somewhere else where it may well 
have even less affinity than in metaphysics. It is thus merely a long-accepted 
foreigner, to whom one grants refuge for a while until it can establish 
its own domicile in a complete anthropology (the pendant to the 
empirical doctrine of nature). 
This is, therefore, the general idea of metaphysics, which, since we 
initially expected more from it than could appropriately be demanded 
and long amused ourselves with pleasant expectations, in the end fell 
into general contempt when we found ourselves deceived in our hopes. 
From the whole course of our critique we will have been sufficiently 
convinced that even though metaphysics cannot be the foundation of 
religion, yet it must always remain its bulwark, and that human reason, 
which is already dialectical on account of the tendency of its nature, 
could never dispense with such a science, which reins it in and, by 
means of a scientific and fully illuminating self-knowledge/ prevents 
the devastations that a lawless speculative reason would otherwise inevitably 
perpetrate in both morality and religion. 'Ve can therefore be 
sure that however obstinate or disdainful they may be who know how 

A8so/Bo878 to judge a science not in accord with its nature, but only from its contingent 
effects, we will always return to metaphysics as to a beloved 
from whom we have been estranged, since reason, because essential 
ends are at issue here, must work without respite either for sound insight 
or for the destruction of good insights that are already to hand. 
Thus the metaphysics of nature as well as morals, but above all the 
preparatory (propaedeutic) critique of reason that dares to fly with its 
own wings, alone constitute that which we can call philosophy in a genuine 
sense.' This relates everything to wisdom, but through the path of

The architectonic of pure reason 

science, the only one which, once cleared, is never overgrown, and 
never leads to error. Mathematics, natural science, even the empirical 
knowledge of humankind, have a high value as means, for the most part 
to contingent but yet ultimately to necessary and essential ends of humanity, 
but only through the mediation of a rational cognition from 
mere concepts, which, call it what one will, is really nothing but metaphysics. 


Just for this reason metaphysics is also the culmination of all culture 
of human reason, which is indispensable even if one sets aside its influ-A8SI/B879 
ence as a science for certain determinate ends. For it considers reason 
according to its elements and highest maxims, which must ground even 
the possibility of some sciences and the use of all of them. That as 
mere speculation it serves more to prevent errors than to amplify cognition 
does no damage to its value, but rather gives it all the more dignity 
and authority through its office as censor, which secures the 
general order and unity, indeed the well-being of the scientific community, 
and prevents its cheerful and fruitful efforts from straying from the 
chief end, that of the general happiness.

The history of pure reason 
The Transcendental Doctrine of Method 
Fourth Chapter 
The history of pure reason 
This title stands here only to designate a place that is left open in the 
system and must be filled in the future. I will content myself with casting 
a cursory glance from a merely transcendental point of view, namely 
that of the nature of pure reason, on the whole of its labors hitherto, 
which presents to my view edifices, to be sure, but only in ruins. 

It is remarkable enough, although it could not naturally have been 
otherwise, that in the infancy of philosophy human beings began where 
we should now rather end, namely, by studying first the cognition of 
God and the hope or indeed even the constitution of another world. 
Whatever crude concepts of religion the old customs, which were left 
over from the rude state of the nations, may have introduced, these still 
did not prevent their more enlightened part from dedicating themselves 
to free investigations of this object, and it was readily understood that 
there could be no more fundamental and reliable way of pleasing the invisible 
power who rules the world, in order to be happy at least in an


A8S3/B881 other world, than the good conduct of life. Hence theology and 
morality were the two incentives, or better, the points of reference for 
all the abstract inquiries of reason to which we have always been devoted. 
The first, however, was really that which gradually drew purely 
speculative reason in its train, which subsequently became so famous 
under the name of metaphysics. 
I will not now distinguish the times in which this or that alteration of 
metaphysics occurred, but will present in a cursory outline only the difference 
of the ideas which occasioned the chief revolutions. And here I 
find three points of view on which the most notable changes on this 
stage of conflict have been founded. 

I. With regard to the object of all of our rational cognitions, some 
were merely sensual philosophers, others merely intellectual philosophers. 
Epicurus can be called the foremost philosopher of sensibility, 
and Plato that of the intellectual. This difference of schools, 
a 

Beziehullgspullkte 

702 



The history of pure reason 

however, as subtle as it is, had already begun in the earliest times, and 

has long preserved itself without interruption. Those of the first school 

asserted that reality is in the objects of the senses alone, and that every


thing else is imagination; those of the second school, on the contrary, 

said that in the senses there is nothing but semblance,a and that only the A854/ B882 

understanding cognizes that which is true. The former, however, did 

not on this account dispute the reality of the concepts of the under


standing, but they were only logical for them, though they were mys


tical for the others. The former admitted intellectual concepts, but 

accepted only sensible objects. The latter demanded that the true ob


jects be merely intelligible, and asserted an intuition through pure un


derstanding not accompanied by any senses, which in their opinion only 

confused it. 

2. With regard to the origin of pure cognitions of reason, whether 
they are derived from experience or, independent of it, have their 
source in reason. Aristotle can be regarded as the head of the empiricists, 
Plato that of the noologists. Locke, who in recent times followed 
the former, and Leibniz, who followed the latter (although with 
sufficient distance from his mystical system), have nevertheless not 
been able to bring this dispute to any decision.50 Epicurus on his part 
at least proceeded more consistently in accord with his sensual system 
(for in his inferences he never exceeded the bounds of experience) than 
Aristotle and Locke (especially, however, the latter), who, after he had 
derived all concepts and principles from experience, goes so far in their 
use as to assert that one can prove the existence of God and the immortality 
of the soul (though both objects lie entirely outside of the 
bounds of possible experience) just as self-evidently as any mathemati-A8S S / B 883 
cal theoremY 
3. With regard to method. If something is to be called a method, it 
must be a procedure in accordance with principles. Now one can divide 
the methods currently dominant in this department of natural inquiry 
into the naturalistic and the scientific. The naturalist of pure reason 
takes as his principle that through common understanding without science 
(which he calls "healthy reason") more may be accomplished with 
regard to the most sublime questions that constitute the task of metaphysics 
than through speculation. He asserts, therefore, that one can determine 
the magnitude and breadth of the moon more securely by eye 
than by mathematical rigmarole. This is mere misology brought to 
principles, and, what is most absurd, the neglect of all artificial means is 
recommended as a method of its own for expanding cognition. For 
one cannot with good cause blame the naturalists for what follows from 
the lackof greater insight. They follow common reason, without boasta 
Schein

ing of their ignorance as a method that would contain the secret of 
drawing the truth out of the deep well of Democritus. Quod sapio, satis 
est mihi; non ego esse quod Arcesilas aerumnosique Solond' is their

curo, 

motto, with which they can lead a contented and praiseworthy life without 
troubling themselves with science or confusing their business. 

Now as far as the observers of a scientific method are concerned, 
they have here the choice of proceeding either dogmatically or skeptically, 
but in either case they have the obligation of proceeding systematically. 
If! here name with regard to the former the famous Wolff, 
and with regard to the latter David Hume, then for my present purposes 
I can leave the others unnamed. The critical path alone is still 
open. If the reader has had pleasure and patience in traveling along in 
my company, then he can now judge, if it pleases him to contribute his 
part to making this footpath into a highway, whether or not that which 
many centuries could not accomplish might not be attained even before 
the end of the present one: namely, to bring human reason to full satisfaction 
in that which has always, but until now vainly, occupied its lust 
for knowledge.
